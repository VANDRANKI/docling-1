Nodes based on imec process flow are generic but representative of foundry nodes. 


Complexity Increase of a Mobile SoC 


• Increase in Complexity node to node where BEOL interconnects dominate 


• Introduction of EUV slows down the 


increase in complexity: 


o Less multi-patterning DUV immersion 


steps 


o Less deposition, Dry-Etch, Wet-Clean, 


Metrology steps 


More interconnect layers and increase in double patterning 


EUV introduced 


More EUV 


Number of Process Steps 


21 


Direct Emissions (Scope 1) 


• Process gases are potent Greenhouse 


gases => Deposition and Etch contribute strongly to direct emissions 


• Multi patterning use many repeats of deposition and etch  By reducing complexity, EUV keeps direct emissions under check 


More interconnect layers and increase in double patterning 


EUV introduced 


More EUV 


Tier 2C Abatement (2019 Refinement to the 2006 IPCC Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories) and GHG global warming potential (IPCC AR6). 


Scope 1 Emissions (kgCO2eq / Wafer) 


22 


Electricity consumption 


• Increase in process complexity 


directly leads to increased electricity consumption 


• Introduction of EUV leads to: 


o Reduce in process complexity o Increased electricity consumption 


of the litho process area 


These two effect counteract each other leading to a continued increase. 


Utility electricity consumption modelled using SEMI S23 standard. 


Increased process complexity 


EUV introduced 


More EUV
