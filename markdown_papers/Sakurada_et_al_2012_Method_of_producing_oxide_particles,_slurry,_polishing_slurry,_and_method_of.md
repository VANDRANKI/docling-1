The present invention relates to a method of producing 


oxide particles, slurry and polishing slurry obtained by the 


method, and a method of polishing a Substrate. 


# BACKGROUND ART

Fine particles of metal oxides have been used in various 


applications. For example, cerium oxide is used a material of 


a polishing slurry, a catalyst, an ultraviolet Screening agent or 


the like, cobalt oxide as a material of a capacitor, a varistor, a 


secondary cell or the like, nickel oxide as a material of ferrite 


or the like, and titanium oxide as a material of a photocatalyst, 


a pigment or the like. 


Particularly, fine particles of cerium oxide are rapidly 


spreading as an abrasive for precision polishing of semicon 


ductor integrated circuits. The average size of Such fine par 


ticles of cerium oxide used as an abrasive for precision pol 


ishing is generally in the range of several nanometers to 


several hundreds nanometers. Various methods have been 


proposed to obtain such fine particles of cerium oxide. 


First, ammonium carbonate or ammonium hydrogencar 


bonate is added to a cerium salt solution Such as an aqueous 


Solution of cerium nitrate, to yield cerium carbonate precipi 


tates. Then, the precipitates are washed, filtered, dried and 


heated to give cerium oxide. The heating temperature should 


be 400° C. or more to thermally decompose cerium carbon 


ate. The size of the cerium oxide particles thus obtained is not 


significantly different from the size of the cerium carbonate 


particles. For example, when cerium carbonate in the form of 


a plate crystal aggregate having an average particle diameter 


of several tens nanometers is heated at 700° C., cerium oxide 


particles in the form of a plate crystal aggregate having an 


average particle diameter of several tens nanometers are 


obtained. Then, the resulting cerium oxide is dry-milled with 


a jet mill or wet-milled with a bead mill, to make it particles 


microparticulated in the range of several nanometers to sev 


eral hundreds nanometers. 


In this method, however, considerable labor is required for 


milling,  and coarse cerium oxide particles  may remain 


depending on the capability of the mill. When milling is 


continued for a long time, parts of the mill may be worn to 


increase the possibility of contamination of the resulting pol 


ishing slurry with abrasion powder. Coarse cerium oxide 


particles and abrasion powder are not preferable because they 


cause polishing scratches. 


There is also a method of obtaining precipitates of cerium 


oxalate by adding oxalic acid to a cerium salt solution Such as 


an aqueous solution of cerium nitrate. In this method, cerium 


oxalate is also heated to give cerium oxide which is then 


microparticulated by milling, so there is a possibility of gen 


eration  of polishing  scratches  for the  same reason  as 


described above. 


2 


thus requiring long time for washing. In addition, the precipi 


tates are so fine as to easily retain water as well, thus requiring 


long time for drying too. When the heating time is high, the 


cerium oxide particles are so fine that a part of them may be 


calcinated to form coarse cerium oxide particles. 


There is also a method which comprises heating cerium 


carbonate  in  water to  give  fine  precipitates  of cerium 


monooxycarbonate, filtering the precipitates and drying them 


at 300° C. or more, followed by milling to give cerium oxide 


particles free of coarse particles (see Japanese Patent Appli 


cation Laid-Open No. 2005-126253). In this method, how 


ever, the step of heating cerium carbonate in water is 2 to 48 


hours, and the step of precipitating cerium monooxycarbon 


ate is 5 to 96 hours, and thus the treatment requires a long 


15 


time. 


# DISCLOSURE OF INVENTION

As described above, fine particles of cerium oxide obtained 


by the conventional production methods may contain coarse 


particles or may be contaminated with abrasion powder from 


a grinding machine. The method of producing fine particles 


free of coarse particles is also reported, but there is a difficulty 


in necessity for a long time in production. 


In view of the problems described above, the present inven 


tion provides a method of producing oxide particles, wherein 


fine particles not containing coarse particles or abrasion pow 


der can be rapidly obtained. The present invention also pro 


vides a polishing slurry using the oxide particles, which can 


maintain a Suitable polishing rate, can reduce generation of 


scratches, and can accurately polish the Surface of a semicon 


ductor. 


The present invention was made by finding that the shape 


of an oxide obtained by heating a carbonate to which an acid 


was added, as compared with an oxide obtained by heating a 


carbonate as it is, is significantly changed.

concentration and reaction temperature of an aqueous solu 


tion of cerium nitrate and an aqueous solution of ammonium 


hydrogen carbonate to form fine precipitates of cerium car 


bonate  and heating the  precipitates,  whereby spherical 


cerium oxide having an average particle diameter of 50 nm or 


less is obtained without milling (see Japanese Patent Appli 


cation Laid-Open No. 2004-107186). In this method, how 


ever, the precipitates are so fine as to easily retain ammonium,

# BEST MODE FOR CARRYING OUT THE

INVENTION 


The method of producing oxide particles according to the 


present invention comprises a step of mixing a metal carbon 


ate with an acid to give a mixture, a step of heating the mixture 


to give a metal oxide, and a step of pulverizing the metal 


oxide. Generally, when a metal carbonate only is heated, the 


carbonate is thermally decomposed to give an oxide of the 


metal. In this case, the carbonate and the oxide are often not 


significantly different in shape. However, when an acid is 


mixed with a metal carbonate and the mixture is heated, a 


chemical reaction occurs between the acid and the metal 


carbonate, so that the carbonate ion is substituted to form a 


new metal salt followed by thermal decomposition to give an 


oxide of the metal. In this case, the carbonate and the oxide 


are significantly different in shape, and the oxide is an aggre 


gate of fine particles. This oxide is an aggregate of fine par 


ticles and canthus be pulverized easily in a short time to form 


The metal carbonate in the present invention may be not 


only a carbonate containing one kind of metal element, but 


also any of double salts consisting of several kinds of metal 


ions, carbonate ions, and other cations and anions. When a 


mixtures of these double salts and an acid is heated, carbonate 


ions in the components of the double salts are substituted to 


form new metal salts followed by thermal decomposition to 


give oxides as aggregates of fine particles. For the same 


reason, the metal carbonates may contain impurities. 


The metal that forms the carbonate includes cerium, cobalt, 


nickel etc. Particularly, when the oxide is used in a polishing 


55 


fine oxide particles. 


# US 8,328,893 B2

slurry as described later, the metal is preferably cerium. The 


method of producing cerium carbonate is  not particularly 


limited and includes a method wherein an aqueous solution of 


ammonium hydrogencarbonate is  mixed with an aqueous 


Solution of trivalent cerium nitrate to precipitate cerium car 


bonate which is  then filtered and washed. As a matter of 


course, cerium carbonate may contain other metal carbonates 


and impurities. 


The acid in the present invention is preferably solid at 25° 


C. It is not preferable that the acid is gaseous, because it is 


difficult to handle the acid or to mix the acid with the metal 


carbonate. When the acid is a liquid or in a solution state, its 


mixture with the metal carbonate becomes liquid so that 


drying is necessary before the oxide is obtained by heating, 


10 


15 


and Such drying is time-consuming. 


The acid in the present invention is preferably powdery 


from the viewpoint of easy mixing with the metal carbonate. 


The size of the powder is not particularly limited. 


The acid in the present invention is preferably an organic 


acid. The acid is more preferably a powdery organic acid at 


25° C. When an inorganic acid such as nitric acid or sulfuric 


acid is mixed with the metal carbonate, a chemical reaction is 


severely caused to rapidly generate carbon dioxide to make 


the reaction hardly controllable, and a nitrate ion and sulfate 


ion may, without elimination, remain in the oxide when the 


heating temperature is low. 


The organic acid in the present invention is composed 


preferably of a carbon atom, oxygen atom and hydrogen 


atom. In addition to these atoms, a nitrogen atom and Sulfur 


atom may be contained in the organic acid, but will, upon 


heating, form a nitrate ion and Sulfate ion which remain, 


without elimination, in the oxide when the heating tempera 


ture is low. 


25 


On the other hand, when a mixture of another organic acid 


and cerium carbonate is calcined, the resulting cerium oxide 


may become massive to sometimes make the pulverizing step 


time-consuming. 


5 


Further, the combustion heat of oxalic acid is low, so tem 


perature control is easy during heating. 


In addition, the number of carbonatoms in Oxalic acid per 


acid Valence is Small, so the amount of a global greenhouse 


gas carbon dioxide generated during combustion is Small. 


It is preferable that when the acid is mixed for example with 


cerium carbonate, 1/n to 12/n mole of n-valent acid is mixed 


with 1 mole of cerium carbonate. When the amount of the acid 


mixed is Small, the reaction may not sufficiently proceed, 


while when the amount of the acid mixed is large, the acid not 


participating in the reaction may burn during heating to dam 


age a heating apparatus, and therefore, it is more preferable 


that 3/n to 9/n mole of n-valent acid is mixed with 1 mole of 


cerium carbonate. 


When cerium carbonate is mixed for example with oxalic 


acid, the mixing molar ratio of oxalic acid to cerium carbon 


ate is preferably 0.5 to 6, more preferably 3 to 5. 


In the present invention, the method of mixing the metal 


carbonate with the acid is not limited, but when the two are 


mixed, carbon dioxide may occur depending on the type of 


acid such as oxalic acid, and therefore, it is preferable to use 


a method wherein the two are introduced into an open con 


tainer and stirred therein. The shape of an oxide to be formed 


will vary depending on the mixing time, but regardless of the 


mixing time, there can be brought about an effect of easy and 


rapid pulverization once the two are mixed. 


In the case of cerium carbonate for example, the heating 


temperature in the present invention is preferably 350° C. or 


more, more preferably 400 to 1000° C. 


35 


The acid dissociation constant pKa of the organic acid in 


the present invention is preferably lower than the first acid 


dissociation constant pKa  of carbonic acid. That is,  the 


organic acid in the present invention is preferably a stronger 


acid than carbonic acid. The pKa of the organic acid is more 


preferably 6 or less. When there occurs multistage dissocia 


tion of the organic acid, the first acid dissociation pKa is 


compared with the pKa of carbonic acid. When the organic 


acid having an acid dissociation constant pKa lower than the 


acid dissociation constant pKa  of carbonic acid is mixed 


with the metal carbonate and then heated, the conjugated base 


of the organic acid is Substituted by a carbonate ion to gener 


ate carbon dioxide, thereby forming a metal organic acid salt. 


When heating is further continued, the metal organic acid salt 


is thermally decomposed to give an oxide as an aggregate of 


fine particles. In the present invention, the acid dissociation 


constant shall be expressed as pKa that is a common loga 


rithm of reciprocal of the actual acid dissociation constant Ka. 


When there occurs multistage dissociation of the organic 


acid, the acid dissociation constant in the present invention 


shall be expressed as the first acid dissociation constant pKa. 


The organic acid in the present invention is preferably at 


least one member selected from Succinic acid, malonic acid, 


citric acid, tartaric acid, malic acid, oxalic acid, maleic acid, 


adipic acid, Salicylic acid, benzoic acid, phthalic acid, gly 


colic acid, ascorbic acid, and isomers, polymers and copoly 


mers thereof, polyacrylic acid, and polymethacrylic acid. 


These organic acids are solid at room temperature and easily 


available in powdery form. The organic acid is particularly 


preferably oxalic acid because oxalic acid when calcined in 


the form of a mixture with cerium carbonate yields cerium 


oxide in the form of powder to facilitate the pulverizing step. 


40 


45 


50 


55 


60 


65 


Because the oxide in the present invention is an aggregate 


offine particles and canthus be easily pulverized, the method 


of pulverizing the same is not limited, but if the average 


particle diameter should be reduced to several micrometers or 


less, drymilling with a jet mill or the like, or wet milling in a 


countercurrent system or with a bead mill, is preferable. 


The metal oxide particles obtained in the present invention 


can be dispersed in an aqueous medium to form slurry. The 


method of dispersing the oxide particles  in an aqueous 


medium includes dispersing treatment using a homogenizer, 


an ultrasonic dispersing machine and a wetball mill in addi 


tion to a usual agitator. When a dispersant is used, a polymer 


dispersant containing ammonium acrylate as a copolymeriza 


tion component can be used. 


The slurry obtained in the present invention can be used as 


a polishing slurry. Particularly, the polishing slurry contain 


ing cerium oxide particles can be used as a polishing slurry for 


precision polishing of semiconductor integrated circuits. 


Examples of films polished in semiconductor integrated cir 


cuits include a silicon oxide film, a silicon nitride film, and a 


silicon oxide film doped with boron or phosphorus. 


The polishing slurry of the present invention preferably 


contains cerium oxide particles prepared by pulverizing 


cerium oxide obtained by calcining a mixture of cerium car 


bonate and oxalic acid, and water. 


The polishing slurry of the present invention is preferably 


a composition containing a dispersant in addition to the 


cerium oxide particles and water. For example, the polishing 


slurry is obtained by dispersing a composition containing the 


cerium oxide particles  prepared by the above-described 


method and a dispersant in water.

The concentration of the cerium oxide particles is not lim 


ited, but is preferably in the range of 0.1 to 20% by weight for 


easy handling of the polishing slurry in the form of a disper 


S1O. 


Because the dispersant is used in polishing of semiconduc 


tor elements, it is preferably a dispersant wherein the content 


of alkali metals such as sodium ion, potassium ion etc. and 


halogens can be reduced to 10 ppm or less. For example, a 


polymer dispersant such as ammonium polyacrylate is pref 


erable. 


10 


25 


The amount of the dispersant added is preferably in the 


range of 0.01 to 5.0 parts by weight based on 100 parts by 


weight of the cerium oxide particles, for the dispersibility of 


the particles in the polishing slurry, for prevention precipita 


tion thereof, and from the relationship between polishing 


scratches and the amount of the dispersant added. 


The weight-average molecular weight of the dispersant is 


preferably 100 to 50,000, more preferably 1,000 to 10,000. 


When the molecular weight of the dispersant is lower than 


100, a sufficient polishing rate tends to be hardly attained in 


polishing of a silicon oxide film or a silicon nitride film, while 


when the molecular weight of the dispersant is higher than 


50,000, the viscosity is increased and the storage stability of 


the polishing slurry tends to be decreased. In the present 


invention, the weight-average molecular weight is a standard 


polystyrene-equivalent molecular weight determined by gel 


permeation chromatography. 


The method of dispersing the cerium oxide particles in 


water can make use of a homogenizer, an ultrasonic dispers 


ing machine and a wet ball mill in addition to dispersing 


30 


treatment with a usual agitator. 


The second particle diameter of the cerium oxide particles 


in the polishing slurry prepared in this manner has a particle 


diameter distribution, so the diameter of 99% (also referred to 


hereinafter as D99) by volume of the cerium oxide particles is 


preferably 1.0 um or less. If the D99 is more than 1.0 um, 


many scratches may occur. The D99 is more preferably 0.7 


um or less to reduce Scratches. 


The median value (also referred to hereinafter as D50) of 


the secondary particle diameter of the cerium oxide particles 


in the polishing slurry is preferably 100 nm or more, more 


preferably 150 nm or more. The median value is preferably 


2000 nm or less, more preferably 500 nm or less. When the 


median value of the secondary particle diameter is less than 


100 nm, the polishing rate tends to be reduced, while the 


median value is more than 2000 nm, polishing scratches tend 


to occur easily on the surface of a film to be polished. The 


median value (D50) and the D99 of the secondary particle 


diameter of the cerium oxide particles in the polishing slurry, 


can be measured by a light scattering method, for example 


with a particle diameter distribution analyzer (for instance, 


Mastersizer Micro Plus manufactured by Malvern Instru 


ments Ltd.). 


In the present invention, the content of particles having a 


particle diameter of 3 um or more in the polishing slurry is 


500 ppm or less based on the total solid content of the pol 


ishing slurry. The scratch reducing effect is apparent from this 


feature. The coarse particles having a particle diameter of 3 


um or more refer to particles captured by filtration with a filter 


having a pore diameter of 3 um. The content of particles 


having a particle diameter of 3 um or more is more preferably 


200 ppm or less based on the total solid content, thereby 


further increasing the Scratch reducing effect, and the content 


of particles having a particle diameter of 3 um or more is still 


more preferably 100 ppm or less based on the total solid 


content, thereby bringing about the highest scratch reducing

effect. 


fication.

The content of the coarse particles having a diameter of 3 


um or more can be determined by measuring the weight of the 


particles captured by filtration with a filter having a pore 


diameter of 3 um. The total solid content of the polishing 


slurry is separately determined by measuring the weight of 


the polishing slurry after drying. For example, 10 g of the 


polishing slurry is dried at 150° C. for 1 hour and then mea 


sured to determine the solid content. Then, the mass of the 


polishing slurry used in filtration with a filter having a pore 


diameter of 3 um is multiplied by the solid content to deter 


mine the total solid content of the polishing slurry used. 


The means that can be used to reduce the content of coarse 


particles includes, but is not limited to, filtration and classi 


The polishing slurry of the present invention can also be 


prepared for example either as a one-pack type polishing 


slurry composed of cerium oxide particles, a dispersant, an 


additive Such as a polymer, and water, or as a two-liquid type 


polishing slurry in which cerium oxide slurry consisting of 


cerium oxide particles, a dispersant and water is separated 


from an additive liquid consisting of an additive and water. In 


either case, stable characteristics can be obtained. 


When the polishing slurry is stored as a two-liquid type 


polishing slurry in which the cerium oxide slurry is separated 


from an additive liquid, its planarization property and polish 


ing rate can be regulated by arbitrarily changing the formu 


lation of the two liquids. When a substrate is polished with the 


two-liquid type polishing slurry, the additive liquid and the 


cerium oxide slurry are sent in different lines, and the lines are 


merged into one to mix the liquids just before the outlet of the 


feeding line, thereby supplying the mixture onto the polishing 


platen. Alternatively, the two are mixed previously at an arbi 


trary ratio in a container and then Supplied onto the polishing 


The polishing slurry of the present invention can be used in 


a Substrate polishing method of polishing a predetermined 


Substrate. For example, the polishing slurry of the present 


invention can be used in polishing a film flatly by pressing a 


Substrate having the film to be polished against a polishing 


cloth and moving the film and the polishing cloth relatively to 


each other while Supplying the polishing slurry to the space 


between the film to be polished and the polishing cloth. 


The substrate includes, for example, a substrate involved in 


the manufacture of a semiconductor device, specifically a 


Substrate having an inorganic insulating layer formed on a 


semiconductor Substrate in a stage where a circuit element 


has been formed, and a substrate having an inorganic insulat 


ing layer embedded on the Substrate in a step of forming a 


shallow trench device isolation. The inorganic insulating 


layer that is a film to be polished includes an insulating layer 


consisting of at least silicon oxide film.

filter was dried at room temperature, the mass of the filter was 


measured, and from the difference in the mass of the filter 


before and after filtration, the amount of coarse particles 


having a diameter of 3 um or more was determined. Sepa 


rately, 10 g of the polishing slurry was dried at 150° C. for 1

For examining the content of coarse particles in the result 


ing cerium oxide polishing slurry for semiconductor pla
