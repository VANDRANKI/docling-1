# Abstract Monodisperse cerium oxide nanocrystals

have been successfully synthesised using simple ammonia precipitation technique from cerium(III) nitrate solution at different temperatures in the range 35–80 (cid:3)C. The activation energy for growth of CeO2 nanocrystals during the precipitation is calculated as 11.54 kJ/mol using Arrhenius plot. Average crystal diameter was obtained from XRD analysis, HR-TEM and light scattering (PCS). The analysis of size data from HR-TEM images and PCS clearly indicated the formation of highly crystalline CeO2 particles in narrow size range. CeO2 nanocrystals precipitated at 35 (cid:3)C were further annealed at temperatures in the range 300–700 (cid:3)C. The activation energy for crystal growth during annealing is also calculated and is close to the reported values. An effort is made to predict the mechanism of crystal growth during the precipitation and annealing.

# Introduction

Materials of nanodimension have been attracting increasing interest worldwide for their unique chem- ical and physical properties (Corradi et al. 2006) compared to bulk due to the enhanced surface area to volume ratio (Kamruddin et al. 2004), quantum conﬁnement and changes in the lattice parameter and symmetry. CeO2 commonly called as ceria, is a refractory material possessing face-centred cubic ﬂuorite-type crystal structure (Patil et al. 2002) which is stable from room temperature to its melting point (Kang et al. 2006). Over the last two decades cerium oxide based materials have been extensively studied and employed in various applications including oxy- gen storage capacitors (Mai et al. 2005), catalysts (Murugan and Ramaswamy 2007), UV blockers (Zhang et al. 2003), gas sensors (Lyons et al. 2002), solid oxide fuel cells (Murray et al. 1999) and in chemical mechanical polishing (Lee et al. 2002; Suphantharida and Osseo-Asare 2004). Numerous techniques have been proposed to synthesise nano- sized CeO2 particles with promising control of size and properties, such as hydrothermal (Mai et al. 2005), reverse micelles (Masui et al. 1997), sono- chemical (Yin et al. 2002), pyrolysis (Oh and Kim

2007), homogeneous precipitation (Tsai 2004) etc. and solvothermal/hydrothermal treatments have been developed towards shape-controlled CeO2 nanomate- rials (Mai et al. 2005). Among different synthesis methods, the precipitation technique has attracted the most extensive attentions owing to the advantages of the simple process, easy scale-up and low cost (Chen and Chang 2005). This method involves the simulta- neous occurrence of nucleation, growth, coarsening and agglomeration processes, which will dramatically affect the size, morphology and properties of the products (Cushing et al. 2004). Materials exhibit grain growth during heat treatment. Control over grain growth during annealing is a crucial aspect for the thermal stability of nanocrystaline solids (Tjong and Chen 2004). The large ratio of surface area to volume for nanoparticles provides a tremendous driving force for diffusion, especially at elevated temperatures. 


Most of the previous reports were focussed on the effect of calcination temperature on growth of CeO2 nanocrystallites (Li et al. 2002; Kang et al. 2006; Li et al. 2003; Hirano and Kato 1999, 2000; Zhang et al. 2004; Zawadzki 2008; Mokkelbost et al. 2004) synthesised through different techniques. Yang et al. (2005) derived the activation energy (E) for growth during calcination for CeO2 nanocrystallite synthes- ised by microwave heating. Chen and Chang (2005) reported the particle growth as a function of reaction temperature in CeO2. Although cerium oxide nano- crystals prepared by the precipitation technique have been extensively studied, less information is reported on its growth kinetics during annealing and no data are available regarding the kinetics during crystalli- sation. Similar activation energy was reported by Tang et al. (2003) in magnetite system. In the present study, we report the effect of reaction as well as annealing temperatures on the size of CeO2 nano- crystals synthesised by ammonia precipitation. The particle size, shape, distribution and crystalline structure of resulting particles were also demon- strated and discussed. 


Experimental procedure 


synthesis, 582 ml 0.05 M cerium nitrate solution was added to *34 ml 25% ammonia in a 2 l beaker at a uniform rate in 1 min under vigorous mechanical stirring, such that the hydroxyl/Cerium ratio (OH/Ce) in solution was greater than 10:1. The reaction was carried out at 35 (cid:3)C (room temperature). A purple coloured precipitate formed within minutes after the addition of cerium nitrate solution. The precipitate turned to yellow on stirring further *20 min indi- cating the formation of cerium oxide crystals. The stirring was continued for 2 h. The precipitation was carried out at temperatures in the range 35–80 (cid:3)C with a total stirring time of 2 h. The precipitate was collected by centrifugation and the excess alkali was washed off with deionised water and ethanol several times. The precipitate was then dried at 65 (cid:3)C in air oven. The sample identiﬁcation code and their synthesis conditions are provided in Table 1. The ceria sample (K1, Table 1) synthesised with 0.05 M Ce concentration at room temperature was further annealed at different temperatures in the range 300– 700 (cid:3)C with 1 h exposure time to study their crystal growth. 


The phase composition of the solid products were determined from the Powder X-ray diffraction pat- terns using a Philips X’PERT PRO diffractometer using Cu Ja radiation (k = 1.5406 A˚ ) and HR-TEM analysis. The XRD data were collected on oven dried powders in the 2h range 20–65(cid:3) at a scanning rate 2(cid:3) min-1 with a step size 0.02(cid:3). High resolution transmission electron microscopy (HR-TEM) tech- nique was used to characterise the morphologies of the materials and to conﬁrm particle size and crystal structure. HR-TEM data were obtained using a FEI Tecnai 30 G2 S-Twin High resolution Transmission electron microscope equipped with a Gatan CCD camera and operated at 300 kV. For TEM analysis, specimen powders were dried at 100 (cid:3)C and were

dispersed in isopropanol by ultrasonication. A micro drop of the suspension was then placed on a 400 mesh copper grid coated with transparent carbon. The grid was then dried naturally in air. Size measurements for the cerium oxide nanocrystals were performed at 25 (cid:3)C by static light scattering (also referred to as Photon Correlation Spectoscopy, PCS) on a Zetasizer 3000 HSA, (Malvern, Worcestershire, UK) using a detection angle of 90(cid:3) and a 60 mW He–Ne laser operating at a wavelength of 633 nm. A small amount of powder was ground well, dispersed in water, stirred mechanically and ultrasonicated to get a stable suspension. Nitrogen on selected nanocrystalline CeO2 samples were deter- mined at liquid nitrogen temperature (77 K) using a Micromeritics Gemini 2360 surface area analyser. Powder samples were degassed at 200 (cid:3)C for 2 h in ﬂowing dry nitrogen gas prior to the adsorption studies. The speciﬁc surface area of the CeO2 powders were calculated from the N2 adsorption data using the Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) technique.

Results and discussion 


The XRD patterns of CeO2 samples synthesised at temperatures 35 and 65 (cid:3)C are shown in Fig. 1. The diffraction peaks displayed almost all the characteristic diffractions corresponding to the face-centred cubic CeO2, matching with the JCPDS pattern (Powder Diffraction File No 34-394) and the peaks were indexed. The crystallite size (DXRD) of CeO2 powders was calculated from the X-ray line broadening by applying full width half maximum (FWHM) of characteristic peak (111) to the Scherrer equation given in Eq. 1 


DXRD ¼ 0:9k=ðFWHM CoshÞ 


ð1Þ 


where k is the wavelength of incident X-ray, and h is the diffraction angle for the (111) plane. The intensity ratio for (111) to (200) reﬂections and the calculated crystallite size of all the CeO2 samples synthesised at different temperatures are plotted against precipita- tion temperature and are shown in Fig. 2. 


It can be seen that intensity of (111)/(200) increases nonlinearly with an increase in reaction temperature. This is due to the predominant occurrence of (111) plane over the plane (200), at higher temperatures as was also suggested by Chen et al. (Chen and Chang 2005). However, the rate of increase slows down with

higher temperatures. The crystallite size is seen to increase linearly from 4.8 nm for K1 to 8.5 nm for K4 with increase in the temperature of reaction. The growth of crystals with the elevating reaction tem- perature proves that the growth rate of particles is predominant over the nucleation rate (Chen and Chang 2005).

where, D is the crystallite size of ceria, R the universal gas constant, T the reaction temperature in Kelvin, E is the activation energy and C is a constant which may depend on the initial value of crystal size (Kotera et al. 1963). The change in the crystallite size, ln(D) are plotted against the reaction tempera- ture 1/T for the samples prepared at temperatures in the range 35–80 (cid:3)C and is presented in Fig. 3. 


Activation energy is calculated from the gradient of the linear regression to be 11.54 kJ/mol. This energy is responsible for initiating the complex process of nucleation and growth by diffusion as well as second- ary growth by Ostwald ripening. The activation energy is relatively small as the nanocrystals have large surface area (not presented here). The growth process involves a dissolution–crystallisation mechanism (Hirano and Kato 1999) allowing a decrease of the free enthalpy of the system by reduction of the surface area. This process is under kinetically controlled regime during the initial steps of the precipitation. 


Activation energy for crystal growth during calcination 


Activation energy for growth of crystals during annealing was also estimated similarly for ammonia

precipitated ceria sample (K1) using Arrhenius equation (Eq. 1). Small portions of the sample K1 were calcined at different temperatures in the range 300–700 (cid:3)C. The furnace temperature was raised at a constant heating rate of 5 (cid:3)C/min with a holding time (soak) of 1 h at peak temperature for all the samples. The crystallite size of the calcined powders was estimated using Scherrer formula (Eq. 1) and pre- sented in Fig. 4. It is observed that the XRD patterns of powders obtained by annealing CeO2 (K1) at 300– 700 (cid:3)C are all identical to that of CeO2. 


The XRD peak-width decreased (peak grew sharper) with increasing temperature and the average crystal size increased from 6.9 nm at 300 (cid:3)C to 17.1 nm at 700 (cid:3)C, indicating that the crystallinity of CeO2 is enhanced by the calcination process. The exponential dependence with temperature indicates that crystallite coarsening is diffusion controlled (Li et al. 2002). Kotera et al. (1963) analysed crystal growth data on MgO, categorising the heating process into initial and later stages of calcination temperatures. Following his model, Arrhenius plot (ln D vs. 1/T) is shown in Fig. 5 for the temperature range 500–700 (cid:3)C where the crystal growth is rapid. The activation energy (E) for CeO2 nanocrystal growth during calcination is calculated from the linear ﬁt of the Arrhenius plot to be 24.85 kJ/mol. This value is close to *20.5 kJ/mol reported by Yang et al. (2005) for microwave processed CeO2 crystals of size *6 nm. The higher value (E)

analysing the size data (obtained for more than 100 particles for all samples, from multiple TEM images). The standard deviation (rTEM) for sample K1 is 0.994. The term rTEM/DTEM (we denote by PDITEM) can be compared with the polydispersity index (PDI) in size data by light scattering techniques where it represents the narrowness of the size distribution (Stolarczyk et al. 2009). The PDITEM is estimated as 0.195 for K1 which is indicative of a monodisperse distribution. The BET surface area of K1 calculated from nitrogen adsorption isotherm is 148 m2/g which also predicts an average particle size for K1 of *5.5 nm (with an assumption that the particles are spherical and nonporous) which is very close to DTEM. The standard deviation (rTEM) for CeO2 sample K3 is 1.65 with an average TEM size DTEM as 7.2 nm which gives rise to PDITEM parameter as 0.229 which also indicates a fairly narrow (monodisperse) distri- bution of sizes in the sample. The particle size distribution from TEM images (log-normal ﬁt) for K1 is presented in Fig. 7. The average particle sizes from TEM for CeO2 samples K2 and K4 are 6 and 8.5 nm, respectively. The polydispersity indices (PDITEM) for K2 and K4 are 0.187 and 0.246, respectively (TEM images not presented here), which also supports the narrow size distribution of the ﬁne CeO2 particles. 


The size measurement data from static light scattering for K1 in aqueous suspension are given in Fig. 8. Z-average diameters are the mean hydrody- namic diameter based upon the intensity of scattered light estimated from the analysis of the correlograms (using the General Purpose algorithm with Dispersion Technology Software v. 1.61, Malvern Instruments, UK).

indicates that higher energy is needed for activation in the rapid growth stage of annealing. 


The bright ﬁeld HR-TEM images for K1 and K3 are presented in Fig. 6. The samples are highly crystalline as evidenced from the sharp SAED pattern (inset of Fig. 6a) and the pseudopolyhedral morphol- ogy can be viewed in the micrographs. The sample K1 is composed of particles in the size range 3–8 nm with a narrow distribution. The calculated average size on 100 particles for K1 is *5.1 nm which is very close to crystal diameter of 4.8 nm calculated from XRD. As expected the average size of CeO2 nanocrystals in sample K3 precipitated at 65 (cid:3)C (shown in Fig. 6b) is higher *7.2 nm (DXRD 7.3 nm) with the sizes in the range 4–11 nm. The average particle size (DTEM) and (rTEM) were obtained by standard deviations

one-shell clusters of a total of maximum 13 particles with average hydrodynamic diameter of *3 9 DTEM which is 15.3 nm. The small nanoparticles of size *5 nm have a tendency to cluster in water to reduce their high surface energy (due to high surface area to volume ratio) and hydrogen bonding in water. This conﬁrms that the distribution of sizes determined from a XRD, HR-TEM, sp. surface area is indeed repre- sentative and the sample K1 is monodisperse. 


# Conclusions

Monodisperse ceria nanoparticles with size in the range 3–15 nm were synthesised by ammonia precip- itation technique in the temperature range 35–80 (cid:3)C. The XRD peak for CeO2 crystals grew sharper with increasing temperature and the average crystal size increased on annealing from 6.9 nm at 300 (cid:3)C to 17.1 nm at 700 (cid:3)C, indicating that the crystallinity of CeO2 is enhanced by the calcination process. The exponential dependence with temperature indicates that crystallite coarsening is diffusion controlled (Li et al. 2002). The activation energy for the growth of nanocrystallites during higher temperature of precip- itation was estimated to be *11.54 kJ/mol which is responsible for initiating the complex process of nucleation and growth by diffusion. Whereas the activation energy for growth of nanocrystals during calcination in the temperature range 500–700 (cid:3)C was estimated as 24.85 kJ/mol. Small increase in the activation energy indicates that higher energy is required for activation in the rapid growth stage of annealing. The detailed analysis of TEM images and light scattering data has shown that all the samples were indeed monodisperse.

The intensity distribution of Z-average diameter (DPCS) for K1 is 16.2 nm with a PDI of 0.315.

PDI value of 0.315 does not indicate a monodisperse suspension (Stolarczyk et al. 2009). This is due to the presence of particles of sizes in the range 5–30 nm with majority being *16 nm.
