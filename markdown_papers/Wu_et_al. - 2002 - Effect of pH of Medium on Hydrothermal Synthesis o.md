Well-crystallized cerium(IV) oxide (CeO2) powders with nano- sizes without agglomeration have been synthesized by a hydro- thermal method in an acidic medium by using cerium hydrox- ide gel as a precursor. The relationship between the grain size, the morphology of the CeO2 crystallites, and the reaction conditions such as temperature, time, and acidity of the medium was studied. The experiments showed that with increasing reaction temperature and time, the CeO2 crystal- lites grew larger. The crystallites synthesized in an acidic hydrothermal medium were larger and had a more regular morphology than the ones synthesized in a neutral or alkaline medium when the reaction temperature and time were fixed. The CeO2 crystallites synthesized in an acidic medium were monodispersed; however, there was vigorous agglomeration among the grains synthesized in a neutral or alkaline medium. It was demonstrated that the hydrothermal treatment was an Ostwald ripening process and the acidity (pH) of the used hydrothermal medium played a key role in the dissolution of smaller grains. It is proposed that the dissolution process can control the kinetics of the growth of larger grains.

# Introduction

C ERIA (CeO2) is currently being used not only as an oxygen ion 


conductor in solid oxide fuel cells (SOFCs)1,2 and oxygen monitors3 but also as catalytic supports4 – 6 of automotive exhaust systems because of its high oxygen ion conductivity. It has been considered that the properties of the materials may be greatly improved if ultrafine powders are used as a raw material. There- fore, preparation of ultrafine CeO2 powders without agglomeration has been intensively investigated. 


Several techniques that include hydrothermal synthesis,7–11 urea- based homogeneous precipitation,12,13 hexamethylenetetramine- based homogeneous precipitation,14 coprecipitation,15 decomposition of oxalate precursors,16 and mechanical mixing17 have been devel- oped for the production of ceria or cation-doped ceria particles. As a low-temperature and wet-chemical technique, hydrothermal methods offer an exciting possibility for the synthesis of high-purity, homoge- neous, and ultrafine powders. Zhou and Rahaman9 reported the sintering behaviors of CeO2 and Y2O3-doped CeO2 powders synthe- sized by a hydrothermal method from Ce(NO3)3 solution and ammo- nium hydroxide solution. Tani and co-workers10 studied the effect of used mineralizers on hydrothermal synthesis of CeO2 powders. Hirano and his co-workers11 showed controlled crystallization of CeO2 particles during hydrothermal synthesis from Ce(IV) salts. It has been found that the agglomeration of hydrothermal CeO2 powders is vigorous though the particle size is very fine.

Cerium hydroxide formed from Ce(IV) or Ce(III) salt solutions can be used as a precursor for hydrothermal synthesis of CeO2 powders. A series of precursor reactions such as polymerizing, dehydrating, and dehydrogenating will occur under hydrothermal conditions and play a key role in the formation of CeO2 crystal- lites. Otherwise, acidity of the hydrothermal medium has direct influence on the structure and reaction of cerium hydroxide. Therefore, to understand the formation mechanism of CeO2 crystallites in the hydrothermal reaction mediums with different acidities. In this article, the effect of the pH of the reaction medium on the crystallization of CeO2 grains under hydrothermal conditions when cerium hydroxide is used as a precursor is reported, as well as the synthesis of nanocrystalline CeO2 powders without agglomeration.

II. Experimental Procedure (1) Hydrothermal Synthesis of CeO2 Powders 


The starting materials were cerium(IV) sulfate tetrahydrate (cid:1)4H2O) and sodium hydroxide (NaOH) (AR grade purity). (Ce(SO4)2 (cid:1)4H2O and NaOH were respec- The appropriate amounts of Ce(SO4)2 tively dissolved in distilled water to form 0.1M Ce(SO4)2 and 0.4M NaOH solutions. When the Ce(SO4)2 solution was added to the NaOH solution, precipitates (gel) were formed immediately. After being filtered and washed by distilled water, the precipitates (gel) as a precursor were put into an autoclave with a reaction chamber of 40 cm3. Three quarters of the volume of the chamber was filled with solutions. The acidity of the reaction medium was adjusted by adding HCl or NaOH solutions. The hydrothermal experiments were per- formed in the media with pH values of 2, 7, and 12. The hydrothermal syntheses were carried out in a temperature range from room temperature to 245°C and the time ranged from 18 to 120 h, corresponding to a pressure range from 1 to 60 bar. After the hydrothermal reaction, the products (powders) were filtered, washed with distilled water several times, and air-dried at 110°C for 7 h. 


(2) Characterization of the Powders 


The phase identification of the products was carried out by X-ray powder diffraction (XRD; Rigaku RAX-10). Grain sizes were esti- mated by line-broadening analysis according to the formula D (cid:1) 0.9(cid:1)/((cid:2) cos (cid:2)), where D is the grain size, (cid:3) is the wavelength of X-rays, (cid:2) is the diffraction angle, and (cid:4) is the half-width of the diffraction peaks. The morphology of the crystallites was observed by transmission electron microscopy (TEM, JEOL JEM-2010). The chemical composition of the products was determined by X-ray fluorescence spectroscopy (XRFS, Philips TW-2404) and inductively coupled plasma spectroscopy (ICP, Perkin-Elmer PLASMA-2000). The products were also characterized by infrared spectroscopy (IR, Perkin-Elmer PE-1600), thermogravimetry, and differential thermal analysis (TG-DTA, Netzsch STA-429).

in Table I. It can be found that the lower the pH of the reaction medium, the lower the moisture content of the sample, which means that the dewatering of the precursor in the acid medium was more complete than that in the basic medium. The XRD patterns of the samples are shown in Fig. 1. The used precursor and the hydrothermal powders displayed all of the major diffraction peaks of CeO2 with the fluorite structure. 


The relationship between reaction temperature and the grain size of the powders synthesized in the hydrothermal medium with different acidities is shown in Fig. 2. Figure 3 shows the relation- ship between reaction time and the grain size of the powders synthesized at 200°C.

TEM photographs of the used precursor and the powders synthesized at different hydrothermal reaction temperature for 18 h are shown in Fig. 4. Some TEM photographs of the powders synthesized at 200°C for different reaction times are shown in Fig. 5. 


In this paper, it is obvious that hydrothermal treatment of Ce(OH)4 is an Ostwald ripening process and the acidity has considerably influenced the hydrothermal treatment process.

acidities are displayed in Fig. 6. It is well known that the broad absorption band located in the area from 3200 to 3600 cm(cid:5)1 approximately corresponds to the O–H stretching vibration, and the one located in the area from 400 to 750 cm(cid:5)1 to the CeO2 stretching vibration. The absorption peaks at 1600, 1500, or 1340 cm(cid:5)1, and 1060 cm(cid:5)1 correspond to the H2O bending vibration, 2(cid:5) stretching the CO3 vibration, respectively. From Fig. 6, it can be concluded that the crystallization of the powders synthesized in an acidic hydrother- mal medium was more complete than others, which agrees with the analysis for the chemical compositions of the samples given in Table I.

of sample weight, and it is expressed by negative (cid:6)m. When the TG curves are out of range of the plotter and are divided into two parts, the total (cid:6)m is equal to the algebraic sum of the two parts (cid:6)m. Similarly, when the DTA curves are out of range and are divided into two parts, the whole curve may be obtained by joining the two parts after shifting vertically the divided part. The dotted curves indicate a temperature change from room temperature to 1000°C, an ascent of the curve denotes a rise in temperature, and a descent of the curve denotes a fall in temperature. The whole curve may be obtained by joining the divided parts after shifting vertically the divided parts. The endothermic peaks with the temperature below 150°C are related to dehydrating of the examined samples. 


IV. Discussion 


(1) Formation of CeO2 Crystallites Synthesized under Hydrothermal Conditions 


Because the solubility products18 of some precipitated sub- stances are bigger (for example, Ksp(AgCl) (cid:1) 1.8 (cid:7) 10(cid:5)10 and Ksp(BaSO4) (cid:1) 1.1 (cid:7) 10(cid:5)10, etc), when Ostwald ripening occurs the smaller grains dissolve more quickly, the solute diffuses more slowly, and the larger grains grow more slowly; therefore, it is assumed that the growth kinetics are controlled by diffusion or surface reaction. However, the solubility product18 of Ce(OH)4 (cid:1)2H2O) is 2 (cid:7) 10(cid:5)48 and is far smaller than for one of (i.e., CeO2 those precipitated substances. When Ostwald ripening occurs, the

smaller grains dissolve far more slowly, and in addition, grains of precipitated Ce(OH)4 cluster together to form agglomerates, so the solute diffuses more quickly and the larger grains grow more quickly. Therefore, it is assumed that the growth kinetics are controlled by dissolution. 


Ce(OH)4 is a basic precipitate, so increasing [OH(cid:5)] will lead to an apparent decrease of solubility of Ce(OH)4, and increasing 
[H(cid:8)] will lead to a sizable increase of solubility of Ce(OH)4.



For Ostwald ripening, there is an equilibrium value for grain size r*. When r is smaller than r*, smaller grains will dissolve and eventually disappear. When r is larger than r*, larger grains will grow. The relationship between grain size and solubility may be expressed by the Gibbs–Thomson equation:19 


C(cid:9)r(cid:10) (cid:3) C(cid:11) exp(cid:9)2(cid:12)Vm/vRTr(cid:10) 


where C(r) is the solubility of a grain with radius r, C(cid:11) is the normal equilibrium solubility of the substance (r 3 (cid:11)), (cid:12) is the interfacial tension, Vm is the molar volume of the solute, v is the number of ions in the formula unit, r is the grain radius, R is the gas constant, and T is the absolute temperature. 


According to the maximal growth law of crystal growth,20 the 


growth rate of the crystal can be written as 


where (cid:6)(cid:14) is the driving force of the crystallization, k is the Boltzmann constant, and T is the absolute temperature. In the solution systems (cid:6)(cid:14) can be expressed as 


(cid:6)(cid:14) (cid:3) kT ln C/C0 


(3) 


where C is the concentration of the supersaturated solution, and C0 is the concentration of the saturated solution. From Eqs. (1) to (3), the following formula can be obtained: 


R (cid:3) (cid:4)(cid:9)C (cid:4) C0 


(cid:10)/C0 


(4) 


This formula shows that, with increasing C, R will increase gradually; and with decreasing C, R will decrease gradually until C is equal to C0 and a new dissolution–recrystallization equilib- rium is established. This can be represented as21 


2CeOH3(cid:8) (cid:3) (cid:15)CeOCe(cid:16)6(cid:8) (cid:5) H2O (cid:9)K5 


(cid:3) 16.5(cid:10) 


(5) 


In this paper, the concentration of the species CeOH3(cid:8) is taken for the concentration of the solute and is equal to C(cid:11). In Eq. (4), C is equal to C(r) and C0 is equal to C* (the solubility while r is equal to r*). So Eq. (4) can be represented as 


R (cid:3) (cid:4)(cid:13) 


(1) 


R (cid:3) (cid:4)(cid:15)C(cid:11) exp(cid:9)2(cid:12)Vm/vRTr(cid:10)/C* (cid:4) 1(cid:16) 


where R is the growth rate of the crystal, (cid:4) is a kinetic coefficient, and (cid:13) is the relative supersaturation. It is assumed that the maximal growth law holds true in this paper. (cid:13) is defined as 


(cid:13) (cid:3) exp(cid:9)(cid:6)(cid:14)/kT(cid:10) (cid:4) 1 


(2) 


This formula indicates that R is associated with C(cid:11).

Equations (10), (11), and (12) can be obtained respectively from Eqs. (6), (7), and (8) combined with Eq. (9). When the concentra- tion of CeOH3(cid:8) increases, other reactions take place: (cid:5) (cid:5) OH(cid:5) (cid:3)

In Refs. 24 and 25, some evidence otherwise shows that Ce(O- H)(CO3) is stable, so it is suggested that the following reaction can occur: 


Ce4(cid:8) (cid:5) CO3 


2(cid:5) (cid:5) H2O (cid:3) CeOHCO3 


(cid:8) (cid:5) H(cid:8) (cid:9)K17

(cid:8) H(cid:8) 


CeOCO3 2(cid:5) has two negative charges and will produce In fact, because CO3 (cid:5), we think that a Ce4(cid:8) greater crystal lattice energy than NO3 2(cid:5) is more stable than a Ce4(cid:8) complex with complex with CO3 (cid:5). Moreover, NO3 it appears that CeOCO3 can be stable as Ce(OH)(CO3). By combining Eqs. (9), (14), (15), and (17), Eq. (13) can be obtained, as shown above. 


(17) 


Hydrolysis and dimerization reactions took place successively (Eqs. (8) and (5)), leading to the formation of CeO2 grains. Because the concentration of CeOH3(cid:8) increased rapidly, a great number of CeO2 nuclei formed in a very short time. Equations 2(cid:8), Ce(SO4)2, (10), (11), and (13) show that in basic solution CeSO4 (cid:8) are quite stable, and it is quite difficult for a Ce4(cid:8) and CeOHCO3 2(cid:5) to be resolved, so that it is difficult complex with SO4 2(cid:5) on the surface for the nuclei which combine with SO4 to grow further.

toward the right and the concentrations of Ce(SO4)2 or shift (cid:8) decrease while the concentration of CeOH3(cid:8) in- CeOHCO3 creases, so the equilibrium of dissolution–recrystallization shifts toward crystallization as in reaction (5). 


With the combination of reactions (5) and (8), the following

Reaction (23) shows that with an increase in the concentration of hydrogen ion the equilibrium of reaction (23) moves to the left and the movement facilitates dissolution of the precursor. The key step for the hydrothermal synthesis of CeO2 powders is the dissolution of the precursor.

reaction of Eq. (13). Because K24 and K25 were quite small and the concentration of the hydroxide ion was high, the dissolution of the 2(cid:5) and grains of the precursor was very limited and the amount of SO4 2(cid:5), which transferred from solid-phase grains to liquid-phase CO3 2(cid:5) content in the solid medium, was very low, so the SO4 phase was greater. Because Ostwald ripening proceeded to a very slight extent, the size of the grains increased only slightly.

equilibria of reactions (21) and (22) lay to the right. With the dissolution of smaller grains, bigger grains grew further until a new dissolution–recrystallization was reached. Because the smaller grains 2(cid:5) in the smaller were dissolved in great quantities, the SO4 2(cid:5) 2(cid:5) and CO3 grains were transferred to the liquid medium and the SO4 contents in the solid grains which had grown were decreased greatly. With smaller grains dissolving, Ostwald ripening proceeds at a more rapid rate and the larger grains grow in a shorter time. 


2(cid:5) and CO3 


In fact, under hydrothermal conditions the CeO2 grains were formed through a series of hydrolysis and polymerism. However, a dimerism reaction is applied for simplicity when the hydrothermal reaction mechanisms are discussed. Although the equilibrium con- stant of the dimerism reaction is only 16.5, the equilibrium constant of the overall reaction has a very big value, if a series of the hydrolysis and polymerism reactions occurring successively are combined. According to the fact that the solubility product18 of Ce(OH)4 (i.e., (cid:1)2H2O) is equal to 2 (cid:7) 10(cid:5)48, it can also be thought that CeO2 CeO2 in aqueous solution is very stable and the equilibrium constant of polymerism is quite large. Therefore, with combination of reaction (21) and the polymerism reaction, the equilibrium constant of the overall reaction is quite large, and the equilibrium is displaced so that the reactant Ce(SO4)2 decreases and the product CeO2 increases even though the equilibrium constant of reaction (21) is smaller. 


(2) Formation and the Elimination of Agglomeration 


It is known that agglomeration is usually harmful to applica- tions of materials and should be avoided. Agglomeration occurs because of electrostatic forces, van der Waals forces, capillary forces, etc. However, some forces can be eliminated in nanocrys- talline CeO2 powders prepared by hydrothermal methods, so that agglomeration can be greatly reduced. The equilibrium constants 2(cid:8), CeOH3(cid:8), of reactions (10) to (13) show that Ce(SO4)2, CeSO4 (cid:8) are quite stable in basic solution. Usually, grain and CeOHCO3 surfaces absorb water molecules, so that hydrogen bonds can be formed between two approaching grains as follows: 


Therefore, hydrogen bonding can lead to vigorous agglomera- tion of grains. Agglomeration will be increased in grains obtained 2(cid:5), and agglomeration will be in basic medium for SO4 reduced greatly in grains obtained in acidic medium for the removal of SO4

IV. Conclusions 


(1) Well-crystallized cerium(IV) oxide powders with nanosizes without agglomeration were synthesized under hydrothermal con- ditions in an acidic medium, if the cerium hydroxide gel produced 


by mixing Ce(SO4)2 and NaOH solutions was used as the precursor. 


2(cid:5) or CO3 


(2) The synthesis of the powders under hydrothermal condi- tions is thought to be Ostwald ripening. The key step in the process is the dissolution of the precursor, which includes the resolution of 2(cid:5) combined with a Ce4(cid:8) complex, and the pH of the SO4 hydrothermal medium has an important effect on the dissolution of the precursor. In an acidic medium, with the dissolution of the precursor, the grain growth is more rapid; and in a basic medium, the grain growth is slower. 


2(cid:5) or CO3 


(3) In this paper, it is thought that agglomeration may be caused by 2(cid:5) with Ce4(cid:8) on the surfaces of two the combination of SO4 approaching grains and the hydrogen bonding between two approach- ing grains. In an acidic hydrothermal medium, with dissolution of the 2(cid:5), and OH(cid:5) on the surfaces of the precursor, the ions SO4 grains are replaced by water molecules; therefore, the combination of 2(cid:5) with Ce4(cid:8) and hydrogen bonding decrease greatly, so SO4 that the agglomeration is reduced greatly.
