11.1 Introduction 


Since chemical mechanical planarization (CMP) was developed in the 1980s at IBM, it has played a key role for integrated circuit (IC) manufacturing (Beyer, 1999). In the IC fabrication process, front-end-of-line (FEOL) and back-end-of-line (BEOL) processes have been crucial applications of CMP (Krishnan et al., 2009). FEOL CMP is the pro- cess that forms the shallow trench isolation (STI) by polishing the gap-ﬁlling materials such as SiO2. BEOL CMP is used to form metal interconnects including Al, W, and Cu. In general, CMP slurries are composed of abrasive, oxidizer, organic compounds such as dispersant and passivation agent, and deionized water (DIW). Speciﬁc slurry formulations are different depending on the materials to be polished. The physico- chemical properties of slurry that have signiﬁcant inﬂuence on CMP performances are determined by the complex interactions between its components. As the design rule is reduced, the demands on CMP performance have become more stringent. Thus, understanding the physicochemical properties of slurry is essential to develop CMP slurries for next-generation devices including new materials and complex structures. 


11.2 Preparation of slurry for CMP 


The CMP process can be divided into interlayer dielectric (ILD) CMP, STI CMP, and metal (W, Cu, and Al) CMP. ILD CMP is a process that polishes dielectric materials such as SiO2 deposited between metal interconnects. Slurries are composed of abra- sive, dispersant, and other additives. STI CMP is a process that uniformly polishes the step height of SiO2, formed by the gap-ﬁlling process, and stop on stopping layer such as the Si3N4 or poly-silicon (poly-Si) ﬁlm. There are requirements on the high polish rate selectivity between SiO2 and stopping materials to prevent their erosion. For this reason, slurries for STI CMP contain passivation agents for high selectivity. Contrary to ILD and STI CMP, metal ﬁlms are hard to remove using abrasives because of their inertness. Thus, metal CMP slurries need suitable oxidizers to form an oxidation layer on the surface that can be easily removed by abrasives.

To formulate these slurries that are suitable for each CMP process, it is very impor- tant to understand the role and characteristics of each component in slurries. In this sec- tion, we will discuss the role and characteristics of each component for CMP performances in detail. 


11.2.1 Abrasive particles 


Abrasive particles are one of the main components in CMP slurry. Silica, ceria, alumina, and other materials have been used as abrasives. Silica abrasives have been widely used for ILD, STI CMP, and metal CMP. There are two types of silica abra- sives: fumed and colloidal silica. Figure 11.1 shows their transmission electron micro- scopy (TEM) images (Zhang et al., 2012). Fumed silica, made from ﬂame pyrolysis of silicon tetrachloride (SiCl4 þ 2H2O / SiO2 þ 4HCl), has been used as an abrasive because of its inexpensive price, high purity, and simple synthesis. However, it forms a network structure in an aqueous media caused by weak hydrogen bonding, resulting in agglomeration. Thus, subsequent processes such as microﬂuidizer treatment and ﬁltration process are essential to formulate CMP slurries using fumed silica. Contrary to fumed silica, colloidal silica can be made with the desired particle size and uniform size distribution through hydrolysis of metal organic precursors (by the net reaction hSieOH þ HOeSih 4 hSieOeSih). Silicic acid sodium and organic silicate are used as precursors to prepare colloidal silica. Colloidal silica, made from silicic acid sodium, inevitably contains large amounts of sodium ions, which can cause severe problems such as damage on the gate oxides of a device. In order to use it, the ion- exchange process is required to remove sodium ions. Organic silicate can produce high purity silica compared with silicic acid sodium, and be used as an abrasive for polishing after the washing and decant process to remove residual precursors. The demands on defect become more stringent with a decrease in device dimensions. Thus, fumed silica has recently been replaced by colloidal silica in CMP processes that require high surface quality of polished ﬁlm.

Ceria has been used as an abrasive for ILD and STI CMP because of its high SiO2 removal rate (RR). It can form strong CeeOeSi bonding during SiO2 polishing, lead- ing to a high SiO2 RR (Cook, 1990).

Ceria abrasives show higher surface quality and selectivity as well as higher RRs of SiO2 than silica abrasives. Thus, as an abrasive for SiO2 CMP, silica is being replaced by ceria. Figure 11.2 shows TEM images of ceria synthesized through the solid-state and solution-grown method (Seo et al., 2014). The solid-state method produces ceria abrasives with a controllable crystallite size depending on synthesis conditions (Kim et al., 2003). However, it has not only large particle size and poor size distribution, but also an angulated shape (Figure 11.2(a)). Thus, mechanical milling and ﬁltration processes are essential to obtain the desired particle size and uniform size distribution (Kim et al., 2006). Compared with the solid-state method, the solution-grown method produces spherical ceria abrasives with the desired particle size and uniform size dis- tribution (Figure 11.2(b)). These characteristics of the solution-grown ceria lead to low defects during CMP. Recently, many researchers have studied the physicochemical properties of solution-grown ceria to develop defect-free CMP slurries. In Section 11.3.3, we will discuss the physicochemical properties of solution-grown ceria in detail. 


As an abrasive for metal CMP, alumina has been used because of high polish rate selectivity between metal (W or Cu) and a barrier metal (Ti/TiN or Ta/TaN) (Krishnan et al., 2009). Alumina abrasive can exist in various phases (a, b, g, or d) depending on the calcination temperature. However, it commonly generates many defects during polishing because of its hardness. There have been several studies to overcome these limitations (Lei and Zhang, 2007; Zhang and Lei, 2008). Lei and Zhang developed the alumina/silica coreeshell abrasive for polishing hard disk substrates. Zhang and Lei reported alumina composite abrasive grafted with polymethacrylic acid for glass pol- ishing. These composite abrasives show improved surface planarization and fewer scratches than pure alumina abrasives because of the cushioning effect of their

structure. For this reason, alumina abrasives have been used as the composite structure rather than in pure form. 


11.2.2 Dispersants 


Dispersants are widely used to improve dispersion stability. According to the DLVO (Derjaguin, Landau, Vervey, and Overbeek) theory, particles in aqueous media can be agglomerated when van der Waals attraction is greater than electrostatic repulsion (Verwey et al., 1999; Derjaguin and Landau, 1941). By adding suitable dispersants, steric hindrance and electrostatic stabilization between the abrasives are obtained, which prevent abrasives from agglomerating. 


Generally, abrasive particles in slurry are known to undergo transitions from bridging agglomeration / stable / depletion ﬂocculation with an increase in disper- sant concentration (Kim et al., 2012). At a low concentration, dispersants are insufﬁ- cient for full coverage of the abrasive surface. The free segments (loops and tails) of the adsorbed dispersant on the abrasive surface can attach to other abrasives, leading to bridging agglomeration. When an adequate amount of dispersant is added, it fully covers the abrasive surface, which can improve the dispersion stability through steric hindrance and electrostatic stabilization. Also, dispersants should have strong adsorp- tion energy with the abrasive surface. Weak adsorption energy between dispersant and abrasive surface causes desorption of the dispersant during a particle collision, result- ing in bridging ﬂocculation (Sigmund et al., 2000). At a high concentration of disper- sants, free dispersants (not adsorbed) can promote ﬂocculation of the stable slurry through a depletion mechanism (Asakura and Oosawa, 1954, 1958). When two parti- cle surfaces approach each other at a distance less than the effective diameter of unab- sorbed dispersants, the dispersants are excluded from the interparticle gap, resulting in an osmotic pressure. This osmotic pressure generates an attractive force between the abrasive particles, which promotes their ﬂocculation. Thus, it is important to add an adequate amount of dispersants for improved dispersion stability. 


Langmuir and Freundlich adsorption models can be used to describe the adsorption behavior of dispersants on an abrasive surface. The Langmuir adsorption isotherm model assumes that the particle surface is homogeneously covered by the monolayer dispersant. It is expressed as follows: 


Ce=Qe ¼ Ce=Qm þ 1=ðKLQmÞ 


(11.2) 


where Qe is the adsorbed amount of dispersant per surface area of particle at equilib- rium (mg/m2), Ce is the concentration of dispersant in the bulk solution (mg/L), Qm is the maximum adsorbed amount of dispersant on particle surface (mg/m2), and KL is related to the afﬁnity of adsorption (L/mg). The Freundlich adsorption isotherm model below is used in heterogeneous systems: 


Qe ¼ KFC1=n 


e 


(11.3)

277 


The Freundlich constant KF and 1/n are constants dependent on the relative adsorp- tion capacity and intensity of adsorption, respectively. The values of KF and 1/n are determined from the intercept and slope of a linear plot of log Qe versus log Ce. 


logQe ¼ logKF þ 1=n logCe 


(11.4) 


A smaller value of 1/n indicates a stronger bond between dispersant and particle surface. To identify the adsorption behavior of dispersant, data are ﬁtted with Lang- muir and Freundlich adsorption models, and the adsorption model with a higher cor- relation coefﬁcient values is chosen. 


Figure 11.3 shows the adsorption isotherm of poly(acrylic acid) (PAA) on a ceria surface. The Langmuir adsorption model (R2 ¼ 0.99) is a much better ﬁt than the Freundlich adsorption model (R2 ¼ 0.87), which indicates that PAA covers the ceria surface homogeneously. 


To disperse abrasive particles that are used for CMP application, several disper- sants have been investigated. Surfactants such as cetrimonium bromide (CTAB) and sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) have been investigated for silica slurries (Bu and Moudgil, 2007; Basim et al., 2003). Basim et al. reported that adsorbed CTAB on the silica abrasive provides a strong repulsive force between abrasives, leading to stable slurry (Basim et al., 2003). However, it also prevents direct contact between silica abrasives and the oxide ﬁlm, resulting in a decrease in the friction force during polishing (Figure 11.4). Since the removal of material by silica abrasive is mechanically dominant, the decrease in the friction force inevitably leads to a lower material RR (MRR). 


Various dispersants have been used to disperse ceria abrasive in aqueous media. PAA has been widely used to disperse ceria abrasive in CMP (Sehgal et al., 2005;

Pettersson et al., 2000). PAA, an anionic surfactant, can adsorb on the highly posi- tively charged ceria surface by the attractive electrostatic force. Carboxylic (eCOOH) groups of PAA adsorbed on the ceria surface are deprotonated to negatively charged carboxylate (eCOO(cid:2)) groups above their pKa of 4.5, which improves the dispersion stability through an increase in repulsive force between abrasives. The ceria abrasives chemically remove the materials through interaction between active sites on surface and ﬁlm whereas silica abrasives mechanically remove the material (Wang et al., 2007; Dandu et al., 2011). For this reason, a signiﬁcant decrease in MRR is not observed because of the PAA adsorbed on the abrasive surface. Kim et al. proposed that the coadsorption of poly(methyl methacrylate) and hydrogen citrate on the ceria surface can increase the repulsive force between abrasives, which improves dispersion stability (Kim et al., 2010). Figure 11.5 shows SiO2 MRR and within-wafer nonunifor- mity (WIWNU) during STI CMP. The results show that the improved dispersion sta- bility leads to an increase in SiO2 MRR and improved uniformity. Also, the number of residual abrasive particles is signiﬁcantly decreased because of the increase in repul- sive force between the abrasives and the ﬁlm. 


There are several reports that show highly active Ce3þ on a ceria surface has inﬂu- ence on SiO2 MRR (Dandu et al., 2010; Kelsall, 1998). Dandu et al. identiﬁed through UV-visible spectroscopy that several additives (arginine, ornithine, and lysine) can interact with Ce3þ on the ceria surface (Dandu et al., 2010, 2011). These additives can block the Ce3þ on the abrasive surface by forming CeeOeSi bondings during SiO2 polishing, leading to a signiﬁcant decrease in MRR. Thus, dispersants should be chosen by considering their chemical interaction with abrasives.

11.2.3 Passivation agents for high selectivity Passivation agents are used for selective removal of a speciﬁc material among various materials during CMP. In STI CMP, polishing is stopped on the Si3N4 ﬁlm after the step height structure of SiO2 is planarized. In the absence of passivation agents, erosion of Si3N4 ﬁlm, which has a direct inﬂuence on device yield, can occur. Generally, an anionic surfactant such as PAA has been widely used as a passivation agent for obtain- ing high polish rate selectivity between SiO2 and Si3N4 (Park et al., 2003; Kim et al., 2008). PAA can preferentially absorb on the highly positively charged Si3N4 surface through the attractive electrostatic force (Hackley, 1997). This PAA adsorption layer prevents the abrasive from polishing the Si3N4 ﬁlm, resulting in high polish rate selec- tivity between SiO2 and Si3N4. Kim et al. controlled the conformation of adsorbed PAA on the Si3N4 ﬁlm with the addition of KNO3 (Kim et al., 2008). As shown in Figure 11.6, they observed that the adsorbed PAA layer on Si3N4 ﬁlm is denser with an increase in KNO3 concentration. It is attributed to the charge screening of PAA by potassium ions. The densely adsorbed PAA layer on Si3N4 ﬁlm, formed at high ionic strength, prevents the ceria abrasives from polishing the Si3N4 ﬁlm, which decreases the RR of Si3N4 ﬁlm from 72 to 61 Å/min, resulting in increased polishing rate selectivity between SiO2 and Si3N4. 


Penta et al. investigated four anionic surfactants with different functional groups as passivation agents for high selectivity in STI CMP (Penta et al., 2013a). Figure 11.7 shows the RRs of SiO2 and Si3N4 in the presence of four different anionic surfactants. All anionic surfactants can form the bilayer on Si3N4 ﬁlm below the isoelectric point of Si3N4. A monolayer is formed through electrostatic interaction between SiO2 and Si3N4, followed by a secondary layer through hydrophobic interaction between the surfactant tails. These adsorption layers suppress the Si3N4 MRR during polishing, leading to high polishing rate selectivity between SiO2 and Si3N4. Contrary to these surfactants, the ionic salt K2SO4 adsorbs only weakly on the Si3N4 ﬁlm, and cannot suppress the Si3N4 MRR.

Recently, various amino acids also have been investigated as passivation agents in STI CMP (Penta et al., 2013b; Veera et al., 2009). Penta et al. reported that amino acids, having both an amine group and a carboxyl group, can suppress the removal of Si3N4 through formation of a hydrogen bond between the protonated amino group of the amino acid and the nitrogen atoms on the Si3N4. The adsorption of amino acids on the Si3N4 can prevent the hydrolysis of the Si3N4. The removal of Si3N4 is signif- icantly suppressed. In contrast with the Si3N4 ﬁlm, amino acids on the SiO2 ﬁlm are weakly bound, and it can be easily removed by abrasives during polishing. As a result, the high polishing rate selectivity between SiO2 and Si3N4 is shown. Since these amino acids are sensitive to a change of pH, they exhibit an “on/off” behavior on the Si3N4 passivation as a function of pH. These characteristics of amino acids can be applied to formulate CMP slurries for next-generation devices that include new materials and complex structures. 


In NAND ﬂash memory beyond 60 nm, the self-aligned poly-Si ﬂoating gates are constructed without the deposition of Si3N4. Thus, polishing rate selectivity between SiO2 and poly-Si plays a key role in STI CMP for NAND ﬂash. Hydrophobic surfac- tants that can preferentially adsorb on poly-Si ﬁlm have been investigated as passiv- ation agents for achieving high selectivity between SiO2 and poly-Si. The selectivity can be controlled through their different surface energies. Poly-Si ﬁlm has a lower surface energy than an SiO2 ﬁlm, and this difference enables preferential adsorption of passivation agents on poly-Si ﬁlm. This passivation layer prevents the abrasive from polishing poly-Si ﬁlm, resulting in high polish rate selectivity. Lee et al. studied the effects of various nonionic surfactants on selectivity between SiO2 and poly-Si in STI CMP for NAND ﬂash (Lee et al., 2002). As shown in Figure 11.8, they reported that the selectivity between SiO2 and poly-Si is signiﬁcantly correlated

11.2.4 Oxidizers During polishing, metal ﬁlms are hard to remove by abrasive because of their inertness and hardness. With the addition of a suitable oxidizer, a metal can form an oxide layer on its surface, which can be easily removed during CMP. Since Kaufman et al. ﬁrst proposed a model of the W CMP process using K3(Fe(CN)6) (Kaufman et al., there have been studies on metal slurries containing various oxidizers 1991),

(KIO3, Fe(NO3)3, H2O2, organic acids, and their mixtures). In general, hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) has been widely used as the oxidizer for commercial metal slurries because of its low cost and powerful oxidizing capability. However, it can form a thick and porous oxide layer with poor surface quality caused by the dissolution and oxidation reactions of W (Lim et al., 2013). 


Fe ions catalyze the decomposition of H2O2 into the hydroxyl radicals (∙OH), powerful oxidants, through the Fenton reaction. These radicals can rapidly form a dense oxidation layer on the W ﬁlm, resulting in high MRR and improved topography of W ﬁlm. Figure 11.9 shows potentiodynamic polarization curves of W ﬁlm in the

presence of 1 wt% H2O2 as a function of Fe(NO3)3 concentration (Lim et al., 2013). The polarization curve of W ﬁlm in the absence of Fe(NO3)3 shows active corrosion behavior because the oxidation layer formed on W ﬁlm is thin. However, with the addition of Fe(NO3)3, the polarization curves of W ﬁlm show anodic oxidation behavior. With an increase in Fe(NO3)3 concentrations, current density is shifted to a lower value. It means that the dissolution of the W ﬁlm is reduced as a result of the formation of a denser oxidation layer. 


Various metal salts (Al, Ru, Ce, Co, Mn, Cu, and Cr), which have multiple redox states, also decompose H2O2 into $OH through a Fenton-like reaction (Bokare and Choi, 2014). However, Fe ions have generally been used as a catalyst to decompose H2O2 into $OH because of (1) high abundance, (2) an environmentally friendly nature, (3) low toxicity, (4) a highly reactive redox cycle between Fe2þ

Recently, CMP slurries for inactive materials such as ruthenium (Ru) and silicon carbide (SiC) have been proposed for new applications (Cui et al., 2013; Kurokawa et al., 2013). Several researchers are studying various oxidizers for inactive materials CMP. Cui et al. reported that Ru has a remarkable MRR with NaIO4 and NaClO because of the appropriate energy barrier between the Ru/RuO2 ﬁlm and the oxidizer. Kurokawa et al. found that a mixture of N2 and O2 gases as well as KMnO4 can in- crease SiC MRR. In conclusion, choice of suitable oxidizers is very important to achieve the improved CMP performances such as high MRR, high selectivity, unifor- mity, and low defects. 


11.2.5 Inhibitors 


In order to obtain the high MRR, several CMP processes may be performed under high dissolution rate of metal ﬁlm. However, they inevitably lead to problems such as poor surface quality, generation of pits, and high localized etching. To solve these problems

in Cu CMP, benzotriazole (BTA) or its several derivatives have been used as a corro- sion inhibitor (Ein-Eli et al., 2003; Du et al., 2004). Notoya et al. studied the formation of various CueBTA complexes depending on the pH (Notoya and Poling, 1976). They reported the highest corrosion inhibition of Cu at pH 6. At acidic pH, BTA exists as a protonated species, making it difﬁcult to form the complexes with positively charged Cu ﬁlm because of the repulsive force. Above pH 6, highly soluble Cu2þ ions can be precipitated in the form of Cu(OH)2 and others. 


Surfactants such as CTAB, ammonium dodecyl sulfate, and SDS were also inves- tigated as corrosion inhibitors for Cu ﬁlm. However, these surfactants may cause poor slurry stability and insufﬁcient corrosion inhibition. Among various corrosion inhibi- tors reported in the literature, BTA is still the most efﬁcient corrosion inhibitor. Although an addition of a corrosion inhibitor causes a decrease in MRR by preventing the dissolution of Cu ﬁlm, it is one of essential components of high planarization and improved surface quality. 


11.3 Characterizations of slurry for CMP 


The characteristics of slurry such as abrasive particle size and distribution, surface chemistry, dispersion stability, and rheological behavior are determined by the com- plex interaction between its components, and have signiﬁcant inﬂuence on CMP performances. 


Among various characteristics of the slurry, abrasive particle size has signiﬁcant in- ﬂuence on MRR. There are two models, contact area model and indentation volume model, to explain it. At the small abrasive particle, the contact area model is dominant. As abrasive size increases, the indentation volume model becomes more appropriate (Basim et al., 2000). According to Cook’s hypothesis, the active sites on the abrasive surface also play a key role in MRR. These active sites are inﬂuenced by various phys- icochemical conditions including pH, ionic strength, temperature, and concentration. Rheological behavior of CMP slurries is also important because their mass transport on the pad can effect three-body (slurryepadewafer) interaction. Hence, it is very important to understand the characteristics of slurry because they have signiﬁcant in- ﬂuence on CMP performances. 


11.3.1 Abrasive characteristics: size and concentration Abrasives in the size range 30e300 nm (aggregated size) have been used for polishing. However, the effect of abrasive size on CMP performance remains contradictory (Figure 11.10). Bielmann et al. reported that the removal mechanism of W ﬁlm is related to the shown in Figure 11.10(a), the W MRR is increased with a decrease in abrasive size (Bielmann et al., 1999). MRR based on the contact area model is expressed as follows (Basim et al., 2000):

where A is the total contact area between abrasive and ﬁlm, C0 is the concentration of abrasive, and F is the abrasive diameter. When the CMP conditions and solid concen- tration are ﬁxed, the MRR is increased with a decrease in abrasive size. 


However, others suggest the opposite conclusions (Tamboli et al., 2004; Lei and Luo, 2004). Tamboli et al. suggested that the MRR is increased with an tantalum and tetra-ethyl ortho-silicate increase in abrasive size in CMP for (Tamboli et al., 2004). As shown in Figure 11.10(b), Lei et al. also showed that larger abrasive size leads to an increase in MRR for polishing hard disk substrate

where V is the indentation volume of an abrasive particle into the wafer. The indenta- tion volume of an abrasive particle into the wafer becomes larger because of an in- crease in abrasive size, which can increase the MRR. 


These opposite conclusions are because slurry formulation and material removal mechanisms are different depending on the types of materials to be polished. In any case, the large abrasive sizes can produce the scratch defects on ﬁlms during CMP (Remsen et al., 2005, 2006). Since the number of maximum permissible defects is continually lowered with decreasing device dimensions, CMP slurries containing smaller abrasive sizes have been investigated. 


The concentrations as well as the size of the abrasives have an effect on MRR. There are three distinct regions of MRR dependence on abrasive concentration (Lee et al., 2009; Luo and Dornfeld, 2003) (Figure 11.11). First, MRR rapidly increases with an increase in abrasive concentration, which indicates that chemical removal of material is dominant at low concentrations. Second, as mechanical removal becomes dominant, MRR is proportional to the abrasive concentration. And third, the dominant mechanical effect is saturated because the contact area between abrasive and the wafer surface is at a maximum. Although the MRR varied with the abrasive concentration depending on the types of abrasives, ﬁlms, and additives, their trends are quite similar. In practice, the silica slurries have high solids contents of 5e50 wt% whereas the ceria and alumina slurries have low solid contents (w5 wt%).

þ] The point of zero charge (pzc) is the pH value when the numbers of [eMeOH2 and [eMeO(cid:2)] are equal. At the pHpzc, abrasive particles show zero zeta potential. This insufﬁcient surface charge between abrasive particles decreases the energy barrier for agglomeration, resulting in poor dispersion stability. Thus, it has to be formulated at pH < pHpzc or pH > pHpzc where abrasive particles have a highly charged surface. Figure 11.12 shows the electrokinetic behaviors of materials used in STI CMP (Kim et al., 2003). The surface potentials of all materials are strongly dependent on the sus- pension pH. The SiO2 shows negative charge above pHpzc 3. Its charge is slightly decreased with an increase in pH above pH 9, which is attributed to the compression of the electrical double layer by dissolved Si ions (Paik et al., 2001). Si3N4 shows a negative charge above pHpzc 6.5 by the formation of SiO(cid:2). In the pH range 3e6.5, SiO2 and Si3N4 ﬁlms show different surface charge. These different surface potentials enable the passivation agent to preferentially adsorb on the Si3N4 ﬁlm, resulting in

high selectivity between SiO2 and Si3N4. Ceria abrasives have the pHpzc at pH 8. With the addition of anionic dispersants, ceria abrasive shows a highly negative charge in the pH range 2.5e11. 


The surface charges of ceria are different depending on their synthesis methods (Figure 11.13). Whereas solid-state ceria forms the hydroxyl groups in aqueous media, solution-grown ceria inevitably contains large concentrations of nitrate ions that orig- inate from the precursor such as cerium nitrate (Nabavi et al., 1993). These nitrate ions preferentially adsorb on the surface during synthesis. For this reason, the pHpzc of solid-state ceria and solution-grown ceria are observed at slightly different pH values, 
## 8.3 and 10.4, respectively. Adsorption of speciﬁc ions on the abrasive surface can
change the surface charge as a function of pH, which modiﬁes their CMP perfor- mances. This will be discussed in Section 3.3.3. 


In contrast with STI CMP slurries, metal CMP slurries have higher ionic strength because of the addition of oxidizer, inhibitors, and complexing agents. At high ionic strength, counter ions are attracted to the charged interface and form a diffuse ion “cloud” adjacent to the particle surface. Counter ions surrounding the interface of par- ticles reduce the surface charge of the particles through charge screening, which causes agglomeration and settling. Choi et al. studied the effect of ionic strength on CMP (Choi et al., 2004). They observed agglomerations of particle at high ionic strength because surface charge is decreased by the charge screening. Although the agglomer- ated particles can increase the MRR because of their larger size, they cause signiﬁcant surface damages on ﬁlm during polishing.

Palla and Shah proposed various strategies to disperse the abrasive particles at high ionic strength (Figure 11.15). They suggested that the slurries with mixed anionic

and nonionic surfactants can improve dispersion stability through steric stabilization. The anionic surfactant adsorbs on the alumina abrasive, and the nonionic surfactant interacts with the anionic surfactant. This surfactant structure is not affected by ionic strength. 


11.3.3 Surface chemistry 


In an aqueous media, abrasive particles are sensitive to the changes in their physico- chemical conditions including pH, ionic strength, temperature, and concentration, which have signiﬁcant inﬂuence on their surface chemistry. Hence, an understanding of the surface chemistry of the abrasive particles is essential for their CMP application. Seo et al. have identiﬁed through Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) that surface functional groups of ceria abrasive varied with synthesis methods (Seo et al., 2014). The eOH groups on the ceria surface can be generated by dissociation reaction of H2O on the defect site. In general, solid-state ceria forms the eOH groups in aqueous media. However, solution-grown ceria inevitably contains large concentra- tions of nitrate ions, which originate from the precursor such as cerium nitrate. These nitrate ions were covalently bound on the surface during synthesis, which have an in- ﬂuence on CMP performance. Seo et al. experimentally and theoretically demonstrated the effect of surface functional groups such as eNO3 and eOH groups on CMP per- formance (Seo et al., 2014). Experimental results derived from adsorption isotherms of silicate ions on ceria surface show the eNO3 group has a much higher afﬁnity with silicate than the eOH group. Theoretical analysis using density functional theory calculation shows that the binding energy of the NO3-ceria ((cid:2)4.383 eV) on the SiO2 surface is much higher than that of the OH-ceria ((cid:2)3.813 eV) (Figure 11.16). As shown in Figure 11.17, the CMP result shows that the SiO2 RR of NO3-ceria (360 nm/min) is higher than that of OH-ceria (274 nm/min). These results imply that surface functional groups of particle surface have a signiﬁcant inﬂuence on CMP performance. 


The synthesis methods as well as pH of the reaction medium have signiﬁcant inﬂu- ence on the surface chemistry of the synthesized materials. Wu et al. reported that the pH of a reaction medium has an inﬂuence on the crystallization of ceria under hydro- thermal methods (Wu et al., 2002). The result showed that grain growth in acidic me- dium is faster due to the dissolution rate of precursor than that in alkaline medium. Ceria, synthesized in an acidic medium, has higher Ce3þ concentrations on the surface than those synthesized in an alkaline medium. Presumable, it shows high SiO2 MRR caused by the high Ce3þ concentrations. 


Abrasive sizes less than 100 nm are extremely sensitive to changes in their physico-chemical environments because of the higher surface energy compared to larger abrasives. The formation of an oxygen vacancy leaves electrons at the surface, which reduces Ce4þ to Ce3þ ions (Tsunekawa et al., 1999). Figure 11.18 shows lat- tice parameter as a function of size of ceria. Tsunekawa et al. found through the elec- tron diffraction patterns that small size ceria has higher Ce3þ concentrations compared to bulk ceria. They reported that it is attributed to the increased surface- to-volume ratio of the small particle.

Surface chemistry of silica also varies with synthesis methods (Zhang et al., 2012). Figure 11.19(a) shows the normalized Raman spectra results of fumed and colloidal silica. Spectral bands at w600 cme1, w490 cme1, and w450 cme1 are related to three-, four-, and ﬁve-membered siloxane rings, respectively (Brinker et al., 1988). Fumed silica has prominent bands at w600 cme1, w490 cme1, and w450 cme1, while colloidal silica has none at w600 cme1. Fumed silica has a structure with an intrinsic population of both strained three-membered rings as well as larger unstrained

rings caused by high-temperature synthesis (>1300(cid:3)C) and rapid thermal quenching. In contrast, colloidal silica structures involved principally unstrained four-membered and larger rings formed by continued condensation reactions. Figure 11.19(b) shows FTIR analysis of silanol concentration in fumed and colloidal silica. Broad peaks at 4500 cme1 are related to the total (hydrogen-bonded and isolated) hydroxyl concentra- tion, and peaks at 3460 cme1 and 3750 cme1 are related to hydrogen-bonded vicinal and isolated silanols, respectively. Fumed silica has a lower total hydroxyl content (2.8 OH/nm2) and a higher portion of isolated silanol than colloidal silica (4.5 OH/ nm2). These reactive sites on the surface produce $OH with H2O2 or water according to a Fenton-like reaction (Fubini and Hubbard, 2003). The reactivity between silica and H2O2 is very important because H2O2 has been widely used as oxidants for metal slurries. 


Silica abrasives show different surface chemistry as the abrasive size decreases. Kamiya et al. studied the effect of silica size on surface silanol structure through FTIR (Kamiya et al., 2000). For relatively small particles (<10 nm in diameter), the isolated silanol is observed. However, as the particle diameter increased to >30 nm, the surface density of the isolated silanol decreased, and hydrogen-bonded silanol groups are Increased due to the strong hydration force between the silanols. These size-dependent differences of surface chemistry of silica can lead to a variation of sur- face charge on silica (Puddu and Perry, 2014) (Figure 11.20). With an increase in the particle size, an increase in surface charge is observed. Although there is no report that the effect of surface chemistry varied with particle size on CMP performance, under- standing the surface chemistry of abrasive particles is very important because it has a signiﬁcant inﬂuence on CMP performance.

11.3.4 Rheological behavior 


During polishing, CMP slurries are transported into the pores of the polishing pad by high speed rotation. These slurries form a liquid ﬁlm between the polishing pad and the wafer, which determines the contact regime between them. Figure 11.21 is the coefﬁ- cient of friction (COF) as a function of a lubrication parameter (hV/P), which is known as the Stribeck curve; it shows three distinct regions: boundary lubrication, mixed lubrication, and hydrodynamic lubrication (Philipossian and Olsen, 2003). Boundary lubrication is dominated by solidesolid contact. In this regime, the COF shows a high value because of direct contact between the solid surfaces. However, the COF is not

signiﬁcantly changed despite an increase in the lubrication parameter. The second re- gion is known as partial lubrication, where the liquid ﬁlm formed between the pad and wafer is more important and the COF decreases with an increase in the lubrication parameter. The third region is hydrodynamic lubrication, which shows the low COF value. The pad and wafer are fully separated because of the formation of thick liquid ﬁlm. The COF increases slightly with an increase in the lubrication parameter. Mul- lany and Byrne experimentally and theoretically investigated the effect of slurry vis- cosity on MRR (Mullany and Byrne, 2003). As viscosity is increased while other variables such as velocity and pressure were kept constant, the thickness of liquid ﬁlm is greater (Figure 11.22(a)). This thick liquid ﬁlm decreases the COF value, result- ing in a decrease in MRR (Figure 11.22(b)). The COF against the lubrication param- eter shows a downward slope. Thus, they suggested that the experiment was processed in the partial lubrication region. 


11.4 Conclusion 


In this chapter, we described the role of each component in CMP slurry, and discussed the characterization of slurries for CMP. Since CMP was developed in the 1980s, many researchers have investigated CMP slurries in a variety of ways. However, there is still a need to understand more profoundly how the slurry characteristics affect CMP performance. These issues can be solved through a fundamental study of powder tech- nology, surface chemistry, and colloidal chemistry.
