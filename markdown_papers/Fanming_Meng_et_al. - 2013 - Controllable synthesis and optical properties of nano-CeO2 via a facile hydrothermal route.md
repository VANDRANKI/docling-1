Morphology control of CeO2 nanostructures was achieved by using ethanol/water mixtures with varied volume ratios from 0:1 to 1:0 in a facile hydrothermal process with CeCl3(cid:2)7H2O as cerium source and N2- H4(cid:2)H2O as mineralizer. It was found that the increase of ethanol/water ratio resulted in the morphology change from thin nanorods to short-thick nanorods, and then to nanoparticles, which is mainly attributed to the inﬂuences of hydrocarbon chains, dielectric constant, and viscosity of the solution on the thermo- dynamics of the reaction system and kinetics of nucleation. Various characterization techniques have been used to study the CeO2 nanostructures, including XRD, XPS, SEM, HRTEM, Raman, and PL spectra. Photoluminescence spectra of the CeO2 nanoparticals exhibited an unique UV–violet–blue emission which is likely associated with the defect states existing extensively between Ce 4f and O 2p bands, better crystallinity of the sample, and higher concentration of Ce3+ ions in sample.

## 1. Introduction

Nanostructured functional materials have attracted much re- search interest due to their remarkable size-, shape-, or surface- dependent physical and chemical properties [1]. Ceria (CeO2), one of the most important functional rare earth oxides, is a prom- ising material for various applications in catalysts [2], fuel cells [3], oxygen sensors [4], magnetic materials [5], ultraviolet blocks [6], and optical materials [7] due to its oxygen storage capacity via fac- ile Ce4+/Ce3+ redox cycles, high mechanical strength, and unique optical properties. It is well known that the functionality of CeO2 nanomaterials strongly depends on the morphology and size of the nanocrystals. Recent reports showed that low-dimensional CeO2 possesses remarkable properties compared with its bulk counterparty. For example, Lu et al. [8] reported that CeO2 nano- rods exhibited a photovoltaic effect upon visible light illumination (k P 390 nm). Zheng et al. [9] demonstrated that CeO2 nanowires have better catalytic properties for CH4 oxidation than commercial CeO2. 


So far, preparation of CeO2 nanostructures is by no means a new research subject, however, much more effort is still needed to syn- thesize nano-CeO2 with controllable morphology-, size-, and com-

position, and therefore the inherited excellent physical and chemical properties that are hard to achieve in their bulk counter- parties including microwave-hydrothermal method [11], a low temperature hydro- thermal process has been proven to be a simple and cost-effective approach for the preparation of CeO2 nanostructured materials. The use of mixed solvent system is a new preparation route, in which the addition of low-dielectric medium to the aqueous solu- tion alters the thermodynamics of chemical reaction and kinetics of nucleation [12,13]. In this work, we report on the fabrication of morphology-controlled CeO2 nanostructures with unique optical properties via a facile hydrothermal route. The structure and prop- erties were characterized by various techniques, including X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), high resolution transmission electron microscope (HRTEM), X-ray diffraction (XRD), Raman scattering, and photoluminescence (PL) short-thick nanorods, and nanoparticles could be obtained by controlling the ethanol/water ratio in the ethanol–water solvent system. Exhila- ratingly, the as-synthesized CeO2 nanoparticles exhibited a remarkable near UV PL, which is mainly attributed to the abundant defect state between Ce 4f and O 2p bands, better crystallinity, and higher concentration of Ce3+ ions in the nanoparticles. The possible synthetic mechanism of morphology-controlled CeO2 nanostruc- tures was discussed in terms of the inﬂuences of hydrocarbon chains, dielectric constant, and viscosity of the solution on the thermodynamics of the reaction system and kinetics of nucleation.

In addition to the diffraction peaks from the cubic ceria, however, the sample D showed extra peaks at 15.54(cid:3), 36.16(cid:3), 39.54(cid:3), and 42.42(cid:3) which are respectively indexed to a hexagonal phase of Ce(OH)3 (JCPDS 74-0665) with (1 0 0), (1 1 1), (2 0 1), and (2 1 0) planes, indicating that mixture of CeO2 and its light hydroxide is synthesized using pure ethanol. The nanostructures synthesized in pure ethanol are signiﬁcantly different from those obtained with ethanol/water mixtures. 


Fig. 2 shows the SEM images of the as-synthesized nanostruc- tures. It can be seen that CeO2 thin nanorods of 15–30 nm in diam- eter and 100–300 nm in length were synthesized in water (sample A), while short-thick nanorods of 30–60 nm in diameter and 60– 120 nm in length were synthesized in the 1:3 ethanol/water sol- vent. Continue to increase the ethanol/water ratio to 3:1, a mixture of short nanorods and nanoparticles was obtained. In pure ethanol, nanoparticles were formed. Obviously, the morphology of the as- synthesized nanostructures gradually changes from long nanorods to short ones, and then to nanoparticles with the increase of etha- nol/water ratio in the growth solutions. There is a very small amount of nanoparticles observed in samples A and B. However, it is hard to see nanorods in sample D. It was demonstrated that the morphology of CeO2 nanostructures is very sensitive to the vol- ume ratio of ethanol to water, which can be used to control the nanostructure growth. The growth condition at a higher ethanol concentration is favorable for the formation of nanoparticles. 


The inﬂuence of ethanol on the morphology of CeO2 nanostruc- tures may be attributed to three aspects as being discussed bellow. First, it is well known that hydrocarbon chains in ethanol may pre- vent electrostatic adsorption. As a result, the growth of long CeO2 nanorods is restricted in the presence of ethanol, which leads a favorable condition for nanoparticle formation. Second, according to the classical Einstein–Strokes equation, D = kT/6pgr, the diffu- sion coefﬁcient (D) of a solute of radius (r) in a solvent is in recipro- cal proportion to the viscosity of the solution (g) [14,15]. It is well known that the g value of ethanol is bigger than that of water [16]. The addition of ethanol into water increases the viscosity of the solution and slows down the mass transfer, which is beneﬁcial to the isotropic growth of nanoparticles. In our work, the sample syn- thesized in ethanol exhibited particle shape, which is consistent with the document [17]. Third, as is well known, the dielectric con- stant of ethanol is smaller than that of water, the addition of low dielectric medium ethanol to the aqueous solution not only alters the thermodynamics of the reaction system and the kinetics of nucleation, but also reduces the colloidal interactions of solid par- ticles, as well as the interactions between particles and solvent, leading to different organization behaviors correlated with the del- icate balance of attractions and repulsions [12]. The dielectric con- stant change with the increase of ethanol/water ratio is also favorable for the formation of nanoparticles due to the fact that ethanol/water mixtures with varied volume ratios possess differ- ent dielectric constant results in the difference in the solubility of the starting materials under supercritical conditions [17]. 


The as-synthesized nanostructures were analyzed by TEM and HRTEM as shown in Figs. 3 and 4. The TEM image in Fig. 3a shows that the CeO2 nanostructures from sample B were mainly short- thick and uniform CeO2 nanorods of 30–60 nm in diameter and 60–120 nm in length, which is consistent with the SEM observa- tion. Fine nanoparticles with a diameter of 6–10 nm were also ob- served. Inset of Fig. 3a is a selected area electron diffraction (SAED) pattern obtained from one of the nanorods, indicating that the CeO2 nanorods are polycrystalline materials. All the diffraction rings could be indexed to the cubic CeO2 phase. Some defects can be seen from the HRTEM image (Fig. 3b), and as shown by white rectangle marked in and 3c. As shown in Fig. 3c, the ordered lattice can be seen clearly and the interplanar fringes are about 0.301 and 0.259 nm, representing the {1 1 1} and {2 0 0} lattice spacing of 


## 2. Experimental details

## 2.1. Material preparation

All the reagents were of analytical grade purity and used as received without further puriﬁcation. Four kinds of CeO2 nanostructures, respectively referred to as A, B, C, and D, were synthesized by changing the volume ratio of ethanol to water. The growth of sample A was performed by dissolving 1.4903 g (4 mmol) CeCl3(cid:2)7H2O in 20 mL distilled water with magnetic stirring, followed by the addition of 6 mL ethylenediamine under vigorous stirring for another 20 min, forming a homoge- neous solution. Then 4 mL N2H4(cid:2)H2O (85%) was added dropwise to the obtained solution under continuous stirring for 15 min. The mixed solution was transferred into a 50 mL Teﬂon–lined autoclave and heated at 180 (cid:3)C for 8 h. After the autoclave was naturally cooled to room temperature, the precipitate was collected by centri- fugation, washed three times with distilled water and ethanol, and then dried in air at 80 (cid:3)C for 10 h. The samples B, C, and D were synthesized by keeping the same parameters as same A except for using 20 mL mixed ethanol/water instead of pure water. The volume ratio of ethanol to water was 1:3, 3:1, and 1:0 respectively for samples B, C, and D. 


## 2.2. Characterization

The crystal phases of CeO2 nanostructures were analyzed by X-ray diffractom- eter (XRD, XD-3) with Cu Ka radiation. The morphology was examined by scanning electron microscope (SEM, S-4800, Japan) and transmission electron microscope (TEM, JEM-2100, Japan) equipped with an attached energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS) system. The Raman spectra were recorded by a Raman spectrometer system (inVia-Reﬂex) using a laser with 532 nm excitation at room temperature. The chem- ical state was analyzed by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). Photolumines- cence (PL) spectra were obtained by a ﬂuorescence spectrophotometer (HORIBA FluoroMax-4P, HORIBA Jobin Yvon) using excitation light of 340 nm. 


## 3. Results and discussion

## 3.1. Structure and morphology analysis

The phase purity of the as-synthesized nanostructures was examined by XRD measurements. Fig. 1 shows the XRD patterns of samples synthesized under different ethanol/water ratios. All the diffraction peaks from samples A, B, and C can be indexed to a ﬂuorite cubic phase of CeO2 (JCPDS 81-0792). They were found at 28.54(cid:3), 33.08(cid:3), 47.48(cid:3), 56.33(cid:3), 59.08(cid:3), 69.4(cid:3), 76.69(cid:3), 79.06(cid:3), and 88.41(cid:3), corresponding to ceria (1 1 1), (2 0 0), (2 2 0), (3 1 1), (2 2 2), (4 0 0), (3 3 1), (4 2 0), and (4 2 2) planes, respectively. No obvious sign of crystalline Ce2O3 or Ce(OH)3 was detected by XRD, but for samples B and C two very weak peaks were indistinct found at 15.54(cid:3) and 36.16(cid:3), which can be indexed to a hexagonal phase of Ce(OH)3 (JCPDS 74-0665) with (1 0 0) and (1 1 1) planes, respec- tively. In addition, a considerable of Ce3+ ions was observed by XPS, as shown below, suggesting that the Ce3+ is distributed at the CeO2 grain boundaries forming amorphous Ce(OH)3 or Ce2O3.

CeO2, respectively. The EDX spectrum of Fig. 3d shows that both O and Ce were observed with an atomic ratio of O–Ce about 1.60. This low ratio suggests that Ce3+ ions may exist in the samples. 


The TEM image in Fig. 4a was taken on sample D synthesized in ethanol without water. Homogeneous tiny nanoparticles were ob- served. The nanoparticles tend to aggregate together because of their large surface energy. The inset shows a SAED pattern taken

shown in Fig. 4d produces an O/Ce ratio of 1.45, which is smaller than that of nanorods synthesized in the mixed solvents and sug- gests that there are likely more Ce3+ ions in the nanoparticles than the nanorods. 


## 3.2. Composition and chemical state

Composition and chemical state of the as-synthesized nano- structures were studied by XPS. Fig. 5a and c shows the Ce 3d core levels from CeO2 nanorods (sample B) and nanoparticles (sample D) respectively. The corresponding ﬁtted deconvolutions of the Ce 3d levels are also included in Fig. 5. The u0 00 (916.99 eV), u00 


(907.53 eV), u (900.03 eV), v000 (897.58 eV), v0 0 (888.43 eV), and v (881.85 eV) are attributed to Ce4+ ions, while u0 (903.10 eV) and v0 (883.99 eV) are the characteristic peaks of Ce3+ ions [18,19]. XPS integrated areas of individual peaks of the Ce 3d and O1s spec- tra of CeO2 nanorods and nanoparticles are listed in Table 1. A semiquantitative analysis of the integrated peak areas can provide the concentrations of Ce3+ and Ce4+ ions in the synthesized CeO2 nanorods and nanoparticles, as listed in Table 2, by using the fol- lowing equations,

(x0) calculated by Eq. (4) is 0.2–0.3 smaller than that (x) calculated by Eq. (3), which suggests that two kinds of Ce3+ ions associated with Ce2O3 and oxygen vacancies in CeO2 may coexist in the sam- ples. From Table 2 it can also be seen that differentials between x and x0 (i.e. x–x0) increases with the increase of Ce3+ ions, which is in agreement with the literature [19] and implies that more oxygen vacancies in nanoparticles (sample D) may form as compared with CeO2 nanorods (sample B). 


## 3.3. Optical properties

To better understand the defects in the samples, Raman scatter- ing was carried out and is shown in Fig. 6. One strong Raman peak centered at about 464 cm(cid:5)1 dominates the spectra from all the samples. This peak originates from the F2g Raman-active mode of CeO2 cube structure [27–29], i.e. a symmetrical stretching mode of the Ce-8O vibrational unit [30,31]. Therefore, it should be very sensitive to any disorder in the oxygen sublattice resulting from thermal, doping, or grain-size induced effects [32]. The inﬂuence of the CeO2 microstructures on the shape of the Raman spectra was observed by the broadening of the line and by the increase in its asymmetry due to the reduction of the phonon lifetime in the nanocrystalline regime [33]. The Raman line broadening of the CeO2 nanostructures can be described by the dependence of the half-width, U, on the inverse of grain size, dg, which follows a linear behavior as described below, 


Cðcm(cid:5)1Þ ¼ 10 þ 


124:7 dg 


ð6Þ 


The grain sizes calculated by Eq. (6) are 4.6, 5.2, 8.3, and 9.6 nm for the samples A, B, C, and D, respectively, indicating that the higher ethanol/water ratio resulted in larger crystallites in CeO2 nanocrystals. This observation is consistent with our HRTEM measurements. 


Raman peak positions obtained from Fig. 6 are 461.4, 461.4, 461.4, and 470.2 nm with corresponding peak line widths of 74,

where Ai is the integrated area of peak ‘‘i’’. 


The Ce3+ ions can be distributed either in regions of sesquioxide Ce2O3 [20] or around oxygen-vacancy in CeO2 [21]. In order to determine whether Ce3+ ions are associated with Ce2O3 or oxy- gen-vacancies, we calculated the oxygen content in the samples assuming that the total oxygen content is the sum of the required O to fully oxidize Ce4+and Ce3+ to form CeO2 and Ce2O3, respec- tively. Then taking into account the differences in stoichiometry x = [O]/[Ce] in CeO2 (x = 2) and in Ce2O3, (x = 1.5), the ratio of O to the total Ce ions (Ce4+ + Ce3+) is determined by using the amount of Ce4+ and Ce3+ ions as listed in Table 2 and the following equation,

Fig. 5b and d shows the O1s core levels for CeO2 nanorods and nanoparticles, respectively, and also show the ﬁtted deconvolu- tions of the O1s levels to the various states. It can be seen that the O1s spectra consist of three peaks at binding energy 529.05, 530.09, and 531.47 eV, which can be attributed to the absorbed oxygen [22], lattice oxygen in CeO2 [23,24], and O related to the Ce3+ ions (Ce3+–hydroxide and Ce3+–oxide) [25,26]. The actual stoi- chiometry x0 = [O]/[Ce] can be calculated directly from the XPS integrated areas of the O1s and Ce 3d peaks according to the fol- lowing equation,

where AO and ACe are the XPS integrated areas of the O1s and Ce 3d peaks, and SCe (=7.399) and SO (=0.711) are sensitivity factors of Ce and O atoms respectively. 


The existence of a considerable concentration of Ce3+ ions in both CeO2 nanorods and nanoparticles was conﬁrmed by the XPS data as summarized in Table 2. Moreover the concentration of Ce3+ ions in nanoparticles is higher than nanorods due to the com- plex reaction between Ce3+ ions and ethanol under alkaline condi- tion according to, 


Ce3þ þ xOH(cid:5) þ yC2H5OH ! ½CeðIIIÞðOHÞxðC2H5OHÞy(cid:3)d 


ð5Þ 


Therefore the increase of ethanol causes more Ce3+ ions to react with ethanol. As a result, the concentration of Ce3+ ions in nanopar- ticles is higher than nanorods. In addition, the actual stoichiometry

the Ce 4f band and O 2p band [38,29]. The emission peaks located between 370 and 440 nm can be attributed to excitonic recombina- tion corresponding to the near-band-edge emission of CeO2 [39–41] and can be partly certiﬁcated by comparing the relationship of peak intensity and band gap. They are due to the 5d–4f transitions of Ce3+ between the 2D (5d1) ground state and the 2F5/2 (4f1) state. The other emission peaks between 445 and 500 nm may be attributed to the transitions from different defect levels to O 2p band. Obvi- ously, the UV–violet–blue emission band of sample D is related to abundant defects in the nanoparticles. Our XPS and Raman results have indicated that sample D (nanoparticles) possess high oxy- gen-vacancy level, which is helpful for fast oxygen transport. Sec- ond, this phenomenon should be attributed to better crystallinity of sample D compared to the other samples, which is in agreement with the XRD and HRTEM results as well as literature [28]. Third, Morshed et al. [42] reported that the strong emission at 400 nm has a major contribution from Ce6O11 phase. Ce6O11 also has a Ce/ O ratio higher than CeO2 and hence a presence of Ce3+ ions in the oxide. Verma et al. [43] reported that the peaks near 425 and 486 nm are characteristic of the Ce3+ emission in Ce2O3 lattice. Based on these discussions, the strong emission at 400 nm may be partially attributed by the presence of Ce3+ ions. The concentra- tion of Ce3+ ions in sample D should be the highest among those samples, which resulted in the highest near UV emission. 


## 4. Conclusion

In summary, CeO2 nanoparticles with a diameter of 5–10 nm were synthesized in ethanol by a facile hydrothermal method using CeCl3(cid:2)7H2O as cerium source and N2H4(cid:2)H2O as mineralizer. Under similar hydrothermal conditions, use of water and 1:3 eth- anol/water mixture as solvent resulted in the growth of CeO2 nano- rods of 15–30 nm in diameter and 100–300 nm in length, and short-thick nanorods of 30–60 nm in diameter and 60–120 nm in length, respectively. The effect of ethanol on the morphology of CeO2 nanostructures can be mainly attributed to the inﬂuences of hydrocarbon chains, dielectric constant, and viscosity of the solution on the thermodynamics of the reaction system and kinet- ics of nucleation. The morphology change of the nanostructures has caused their optical properties signiﬁcantly different. The CeO2 nanoparticles showed a broad strong emission in the near UV which distinguished from those grown under different condi- tions. The unique UV–violet–blue emission of the nanoparticles may mainly originated from defect state existing extensively be- tween the Ce 4f band and O 2p band, better crystallinity of the sample compared to those of other three samples, and higher con- centration of Ce3+ ions in sample. The controllable morphologies, microstructures, and optical properties of CeO2 should make the nanomaterials excellent candidates for applications in oxygen transportation, catalysts, fuel cells, ultraviolet blocks and lumines- cent materials.

68, 50, and 46 cm(cid:5)1 for samples A, B, C, and D, respectively. Several factors may have caused the changes in the main Raman peak po- sition and line width, including phonon conﬁnement, strain, broad- ening associated with the size distribution, defects, and variations in phonon relaxation with particle sizes [28]. It is likely that Ce3+ ions and oxygen vacancies in these samples are responsible for the changes in the Raman scattering as supported by the XPS and PL data. 


The second-order features at 1172 cm(cid:5)1 are very prominent in the samples D and C. But it is hard to see this peak for sample B. It can be attributed to the second-order Raman mode of surface superoxide species (O(cid:5) 2 ), and has little additional contributions from F2g symmetry [27]. Moreover, the relative intensity of sample D at about 1172 cm(cid:5)1 is obviously higher than other samples, implying the nanoparticles have more oxygen vacancies than other three samples. In fact the peak at about 1172 cm(cid:5)1 is so broad and symmetrical that it makes no sense to assign it to a single critical point phonon overtone, rather, Weber et al. [27] simply assigned it to 2LO. The shoulder peak ranging from 560 to 600 cm(cid:5)1 can be attributed to the presence of Ce3+ ions and oxygen vacancies 
[34]. The peak at about 828 cm(cid:5)1 could be due to a second-order
phonon, a local mode centered on vacancies, or the presence of an- other elemental species [28]. The peak near 260 cm(cid:5)1 can be attributed to disorder in the system [32]. 


CeO2 is a wide band gap semiconductor, whose Ce 4f energy lev- els localize at the forbidden band and lie about 3 eV above the va- lence band (O 2p) with width of 1.2 eV [35–37]. Its defect levels localized between the Ce 4f band and O 2p band can lead to wider emission bands. Fig. 7 shows the room temperature PL spectra of CeO2 nanostructures synthesized under different ethanol/water ra- tios. Numerous emission peaks located at (cid:6)373, 383, 400, 420, 439, 450, 462, 468, 472, 482, 492, 542, and 564 nm are observed. These emission peaks between 400 and 500 nm form a broad emission band. Their PL intensities are slightly different from each other but the main emission peak maintains at 468 nm for samples A, B, and C. However, the PL spectrum of sample D is characterized with a wider and strong UV–violet–blue emission band ranging from 370 to 500 nm and a peak position at 406 nm instead of 468 nm as observed in the other samples. This is a very interesting and novel phenomenon. Maensiri et al. [30] reported the depen- dence of PL blue-shift on calcining temperature. From Fig. 7, it can be also seen that the peak intensity decreases with the increase of ethanol/water ratio from 0:1 up to 3:1 and then increases. 


The strong broad UV–violet–blue emission band ranging from 370 to 500 nm of sample D may be understood as below. First, it may originate from the defect state existing extensively between
