# Abstract

Effects of reaction temperature and atmosphere on properties of the CeO2 particles prepared by the precipitation technique, including particle size, shape, and crystalline structure were investigated. Also, the bandgap energies were estimated from the UV absorption spectra. Experimental results showed that the prepared particles were primary, non-porous and with cubic ﬂuorite structure. The reaction temperature and oxygen content of O2/N2 atmosphere played important roles on the size and shape of resulting particles. The average particle size as well as the crystallite size increased with increasing the reaction temperature and decreasing the oxygen content. Besides, the particle shape transformed from square-like to hexagonal as the temperature was raised from 30 to 90 8C. In oxygen-lean atmosphere, the shape of all resulting particles was hexagonal, whereas needles mixed with hexagonal particles found at above 50% O2. Due to the quantum conﬁnement effect, the bandgap energies of particles over the studied conditions approximately increased with decreasing particle size. However, the oxygen-induced shape change exhibited an exceptional deviation. # 2004 Elsevier Ltd and Techna Group S.r.l. All rights reserved.

## 1. Introduction

In recent years, nanocrystalline cerium oxide (CeO2) particles have been extensively studied owing to their potential uses in many applications, such as UV absorbents and ﬁlters [1,2], buffer layers with silicon wafer [3], gas sensors [4], catalysts in the fuel cell technology [5–7], catalytic wet oxidation [8], engine exhaust catalysts [9], NO removal [10], photocatalytic oxidation of water [11], etc. However, the material performances in practical uses are strongly inﬂuenced by the properties of constituent CeO2 particles. 


Numerous techniques have been proposed to synthesize nano-sized CeO2 particles with promising control of properties, such as hydrothermal [12–16], reverse micelles 
[1,17], sonochemical [18], pyrolysis [19] and homogeneous
precipitation [2,20–24]. Among them, owing to the

advantages of simple process, easy scale-up and low cost, the precipitation technique has attracted the most extensive attentions. For example, Zhou et al. [20] produced CeO2 particles of about 4 nm from cerium nitrate and ammonia. Matijevic´ and Hsu [21] prepared sub-micron Ce2O- (CO3)2(cid:1)H2O particles from cerium nitrate with urea. Chen and Chen [22] prepared CeO2 particles from cerium nitrate with hexamethylenetetramine, whereas Li et al. [23] used ammonia carbonate and diethylamine as the precipitate agents. Yamashita et al. [2] produced CeO2 particles from cerium chloride and sodium hydroxide with the presence of hydrogen peroxide under various pH conditions from 6 to 12. Uekawa et al. [24] obtained 7–9 nm CeO2 particles starting from cerium nitrate in the polyethylene glycol solution. Although CeO2 particles prepared by the pre- cipitation technique have been extensively studied, most of the previous reports were focused on effects of cerium precursors, ligands, additives and reaction media. Less information was reported on the inﬂuences of reaction temperature and atmosphere. Therefore, in the present work,

it was attempted to study the effects of reaction temperature and oxygen content of atmosphere on the formation of CeO2 particles. The particle size, morphology, shape, crystalline structure and UV absorption of resulting particles were also demonstrated and discussed. 


## 2. Experimental

All chemicals were reagent grade and used without further puriﬁcation. A 50 ml of aqueous cerium nitrate (Ce(NO3)3(cid:1)6H2O, Strem, 99.9%) solution (0.2 M) was used as the cerium precursor. Firstly, 25 ml of ammonia water (from Riedel-de Hae¨n Co.) was totally added into the cerium precursor solution. The reaction was carried out at the desired temperature with a stirring rate of 500 rpm. A stream of O2/N2 mixture was bubbled into the reactor to oxidize Ce(III) to Ce(IV). The oxygen content of the atmosphere for this study was ranged from 5% to pure oxygen, which was measured with a gas chromatograph (GC14B, Shimadzu). At the beginning of reaction, a white precipitate came out in the solution immediately. Subsequently, the color of precipitates turned into purple, and gradually became light yellow. The time required for completing the reaction was 2 h. Finally, the precipitate was centrifuged, and followed by washing with de-ionized water and ethanol alternatively for three times. 


The pH value of the reaction solution was recorded with a pH meter (HM-20S, TOA, Japan). The morphologies of as- prepared CeO2 nanoparticles were observed by TEM (1200EX, JEOL). An appropriate amount of CeO2 suspen- sion was dropped onto carbon-coated copper grids for TEM observation. The average particle size (dTEM) and particle size distribution were determined from TEM images by counting more than 100 particles. However, needle-like particles were excluded from the size calculation. The HRTEM (3010, JEOL) with an accelerating voltage of 300 kV was employed for larger magniﬁed observations. The crystalline structure was studied by using XRD (RX-III, Rigaku), and the crystallite size of samples, dXRD, was estimated by applying full-width-half-maximum (FWHM) of characteristic peak (1 1 1) to the Scherrer equation: 


dXRD ¼ 


0:9l FWHM cos u 


(1) 


where l was the incident wavelength (1.5406 A˚ in this study) of X-ray, and u was the diffraction angle for the (1 1 1) plane. The particle size of samples measured by nitrogen adsorption at 77 K (ASAP 2010, Micromeritics), dBET, was calculated by using the Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) equation with assuming that the CeO2 particles were spherical and non-porous [20]. The bandgap energies of samples were estimated from the UV–vis absorption spectra (UV–vis spectrophotometer, Lambda 20, Perkin Elmer). The sample loading in ethanol for the measurement was in range of 0.08–0.15 g/L.

## 3. Results and discussion

## 3.1. CeO2 formation mechanism and pH evolution

The formation of CeO2 involves several complicated reactions [25–27]. As the ammonia water is totally added into the cerium precursor solution, the Ce(OH)3 precipitate is formed immediately due to the extreme low solubility constant the Ce(OH)3 was oxidized to hydrated Ce(IV) ions in alkaline envi- ronment 
[27], and then further hydrolyzed to form

[Ce(OH)x(H2O)y](4(cid:4)x)+ complex [13,22]. Finally, the cer-

ium(IV) hydroxide complex is deprotonated by water molecules to form cerium oxide (CeO2) [27]. It is noticed that the hydroxyl ions are highly involved in the whole process, which would strongly affect the supersaturation degree of initial precipitate [20] and the oxidation of Ce(III) to Ce(IV) [22]. Therefore, the concentration of hydroxyl ions, i.e., alternatively indicated by the pH of solution, plays an important role on determining the particle morphology 
[2] and the resulting suspension state [27]. Since the
evolution of pH value indeed corresponds to the extent of reaction, monitoring the pH change is helpful to comprehend the formation mechanism of CeO2 particles. 


The variation of pH with reaction time at different ammonia concentrations is shown in Fig. 1. As the 


concentration of ammonia water is 1.2 M, the pH value decreases slowly within initial 5 min and then falls down abruptly. The abrupt pH drop indicates that considerable hydroxyl ions are consumed in this stage. Zhou et al. [20] and Chen and Chen [22] reported, higher concentration of hydroxyl ions would favor the Ce(III)/Ce(IV) oxidation, and the hydronium ions (H3O+) were released moreover, accompanying with the Ce(III)/Ce(IV) oxidation and causing the sharp decrease of pH. In the subsequent hydrolysis and deprotonation steps, hydroxyl ions are substantially depleted at a slower rate. Even though the reaction time is further prolonged to 400 min, the pH value decreases no more, which reveals the dissolution and recrystallization of particles are performed in this stage. At

very good consistence with dXRD and dTEM. Therefore, the prepared particles are conﬁrmed to be primary and non- porous. 


From Fig. 3, the shape of CeO2 particles is strongly dependent on the reaction temperature. At 30 8C, the prepared particles are shaped square-like, whereas they are transformed into hexagonal shape at higher temperature. To 


The typical XRD pattern of prepared CeO2 particles is shown as the inset of Fig. 2. The characteristic peaks are very close to the cubic ﬂuorite structured CeO2 crystal in the JCPDS database. Besides, the XRD patterns in 2u ranges of 25–358 (Fig. 2) show that samples prepared at lower temperatures exhibit broader peaks shifting toward a little smaller angles. 


The TEM images of CeO2 nanoparticles prepared at 30, 50, 70, and 90 8C (Fig. 3) demonstrate fairly uniform size distributions. Moreover, the particle size increases with elevating the reaction temperature, inferred that the growth rate of particles is predominant over the nucleation rate. This result is in good agreement with that reported by Wu et al. [12]. As shown in Table 1, the average particle size obtained from TEM (dTEM) is quite close to the crystallite size obtained from XRD patterns (dXRD). This clearly indicates the presence of agglomerates in CeO2 particles can be neglected at various reaction temperatures. In addition, the BET average particle size, dBET, based on assumptions of non-porous and spherical particles, shows

the XRD patterns. The intensity ratio of plane (1 1 1) to 
# (2 0 0), A(1 1 1)/A(2 0 0),
increases with increasing the reaction temperature (Fig. 5). Obviously, this depicts the occurrence probability of plane (1 1 1) is predominant over the plane (2 0 0), which is in good accordance with the HRTEM results and also agrees with reports of Kirk and Wood [30].

further observe the particles obtained at 30 8C by HRTEM, two square-like crystals with truncated corners are shown in Fig. 4a and b, respectively. One is with {1 1 1} facets which grow along the diagonal direction (Fig. 4a), and the other is with {1 0 0} facets which are along the edge of square (Fig. 4b). The interplanar spacings for {1 1 1} and {1 0 0} facets are determined as 0.32 and 0.27 nm, respectively. As raising the reaction temperature to 90 8C, larger particles are appeared (Fig. 4c). Besides, since the {1 0 0} facets with higher surface energy grow slower than {1 1 1} facets, it results in the particles growing from truncated cubes to cubo-octahedrons, and thus the corresponding images transforming from square-like to hexagonal shape [28,29]. Alternatively, the shape evolution can also be conﬁrmed by

This equation indicates that the oxidation of Ce(III) to Ce(IV) is strongly inﬂuenced by the oxygen content of atmosphere. Fig. 6 shows the effect of oxygen content on the particle morphology. At 5% O2 ambient, the resulting particles are all hexagonal. When the oxygen content increases to 50%, few needles appear mixed with hexagonal particles. With increasing the oxygen content, the amount of needle-like particles is increased. Yamashita et al. [2] reported that the needle-like structure was preferred to appear in alkaline media with the presence of hydrogen peroxide via topotactic mechanism [2]. Zhou et al. [26] proposed that the dissolved oxygen most likely caused the slow oxidation of Ce(III) to Ce(IV) and thus resulted in a ﬁner and less agglomerated particles. In other words, at oxygen-rich ambient or by reacting with strong oxidant H2O2, it would beneﬁt the formation of needle-like and ﬁner particles. Eventually, as listed in Table 1, the average particle sizes, dTEM and dXRD, consistently decrease with increasing the oxygen content. However, the true mechanism for morphological evolution has not been fully understood. 


## 3.4. Effects of reaction temperature and atmosphere

on the lattice relaxation 


The lattice relaxation accompanied with reducing the particle size is of great importance and would strongly affect the properties of CeO2 nanoparticles [31]. Fig. 7 illustrates the dependence of lattice parameter on the crystallite size varying with reaction temperature and atmosphere. As can be found, the lattice parameter decreases consistently with increasing the crystallite size, and is larger than 5.41 A˚ for bulk CeO2 crystal [32,33], regardless of changing tempera- ture or atmosphere. Although the oxygen content of 


atmosphere is indeed an important factor on determining the size and shape of resulting particles, the variation of lattice parameter by oxygen content (within 0.12%) seems, however, less signiﬁcant than the variation of temperature effect (within 0.27%). 


## 3.5. UV absorption and bandgap energy

As previously reported [34], 


the size-induced lattice relaxation was usually resulted from the higher percentage of Ce(III) in CeO2 crystals, which would demonstrate a blue shift of edge absorption in UV–vis absorption spectra. Fig. 8 shows the absorption edge obviously shifts toward shorter wavelength, i.e., blue shift, due to the decrease of particle size by lowering the reaction temperature. The direct bandgap energy can be determined by extrapolating the absorption coefﬁcient (a) to zero [1,17] with ðaEphotonÞ2 ¼ CdirðEphoton (cid:4) EdirÞ 


(3) 


where Cdir is the absorption constant and Edir is the bandgap energy for direct transition. Conventionally, the absorption coefﬁcient (a) is deﬁned as [1,17] 


a ¼ 


2:303Absr Lc 


(4) 


where Abs is the absorbance of the sample, c is the sample loading and the L is the path length (L = 1 cm). The density of CeO2, r, is taken as 7.28 g/cm3 [1]. From the plot of (aEphoton)2 versus Ephoton (Fig. 9), it reveals that the bandgap decreases from 3.71 to 3.56 eV as the reaction temperature increases from 30 to 90 8C. Furthermore, the indirect band- gap energy can be also determined from the inset of Fig. 9. Similarily, it is found that the indirect bandgap energy

decreases from 3.08 to 2.89 eV. Comparing the estimated bandgap energies (Fig. 10), it clearly reveals that, due to the quantum size effect, either direct or indirect bandgap ener- gies are mostly larger than values of bulk powders (3.19 eV for direct transition, and 3.01 eV for indirect transition) [1]. In addition, the bandgap energy increases with decreasing the crystallite size by either lowering the reaction tempera- ture or increasing the oxygen content. However, a break is occurred at 21–50% O2, which encounters the structure and shape transformations for CeO2 crystals. 


## 4. Conclusion

From the present results, the properties of prepared CeO2 nanoparticles are strongly dependent on the reaction temperature and oxygen content of O2/N2 atmosphere. Over the whole studied conditions, the resulting particles are characterized to be primary, non-porous and with cubic ﬂuorite structure. The average particle size can be increased by either increasing the reaction temperature or decreasing the oxygen content. Raising the reaction temperature from 30 to 90 8C, the particle shape changes from square-like to hexagonal. Moreover, the particles are shaped hexagonal, whereas needles mixed with hexagonal-shaped particles appeared at oxygen content above 50%. The bandgap energies of prepared CeO2 particles can be approximately modulated by varying the particle size based on the quantum conﬁnement effect, however, the oxygen-induced shape change might cause deviation to some extent.
