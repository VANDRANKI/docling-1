This   paper   describes   synthesis   of   spherical   and  highly   mono-dispersed   ceria   coated   silica   nanoparticles   of ∼70–80   nm   for   application   as   abrasive   particles   in   Chemical   Mechanical   Planarization   (CMP)   process. size Core   silica   nanoparticles   were   initially   synthesized   using   micro-emulsion   method.   Ceria   coating   on  these ultraﬁne   and   spherical   silica   nanoparticles   was   achieved   using   controlled   chemical   precipitation   method. Study   of   various   parameters   inﬂuencing   the   formation   of   ceria   coated   silica   nanoparticles   of  size   less than   100  nm   has   been   undertaken   and  reported.   Ceria   coating   over  silica   nanoparticles   was   varied   by controlling   the   reaction   temperature,   pH  and   precursor   concentrations.   Characterization   studies   using X-ray  diffraction,   scanning   electron   microscopy,   transmission   electron   microscopy   and  Energy   Dispersive ∼10  nm   thickness   over   silica   with   spherical X-ray  analysis   show   formation   of   crystalline   CeO2 coating   of morphology   and   particle   size   <100   nm.   Aqueous   slurry   of   ceria   coated   silica   abrasive   was   prepared   and employed   for   polishing   of  oxide   and  nitride   ﬁlms   on   silicon   substrates.   Polished   ﬁlms   were   studied   using ellipsometry   and   an   improvement   in   SiO2:SiN   selective   removal   rates   up   to   12   was   observed   using   1   wt% ceria  coated   silica   nanoparticles   slurry.

## 1.  Introduction

Chemical  Mechanical  Polishing  (CMP)  processes  are  being  uti- lized  to  achieve  global  planarization  of  substrates  with  surface coatings  of  varying  thickness  ranging  from  nanometres  to  several micrometres,  with  desired  selectivity  and  minimum  defects  [1–3]. Initially,  CMP   was  majorly  used  for  planarization  of  silicon  sub- strates  but  has  also  subsequently  found  application  in  polishing semiconductors,  metals  and  polymer  surfaces  for  technologies  like integrated  circuit  (IC)  manufacturing  and  micro-electromechanical systems  (MEMS)  [2].  In  CMP,  both  chemical  and  mechanical  prop- erties  of  the  abrasive  particles  play  a  crucial  role  in  achieving  high polishing  rates.  The  chemical  nature,  size  and  shape  of  the  abrasive particles  used  in  polishing  slurry  play  a  crucial  role  in  achieving  the desired  CMP   results.  Silica  particles  have  been  used  extensively  as an  abrasive  in  polishing  industry.  Recently  ceria  has  also  been  used as  an  abrasive  because  of  its  high  chemical  selectivity,  in  compari- son  to  silica  [4–6].

Employment  of  technologies  like  shallow  trench  isolation  (STI), which  isolates  neighbouring  semiconductor  devices  in  an  IC  cir- cuit,  critically  depends  on  the  planarization  capacity  of  CMP   process 
[15,16].  In  STI  the  CMP   process  is  used  to  polish  off  the  SiO2 dielec-
tric  layer,  down  to  the  underlying  nitride,  and  stops  at  the  nitride layer.  STI  heavily  depends  on  CMP   for  selective  removal  of  SiO2 over  SiN  layer.  Towards  this  end,  CMP   slurry  must  have  high  selec- tivity  to  oxide  with  respect  to  the  nitride,  and  should  leave  the surface,  planar  and  defect-free  [5].  Cook  et  al.  estimated  that  one SiO2 molecule  is  removed  for  every  twenty-four  collisions  between ceria  abrasive  and  silica  substrate  compare  to  500  million  collisions required  in  the  case  of  silica  abrasive.  Ceria  slurries,  selective  pol- ishing  of  silicon  oxide  over  silicon  nitride  ﬁlms  and  higher  removal rates  is  explained  based  on  ceria’s  inherently  superior  chemical selectivity  and  higher  polishing  rates,  compared  to  silica  abrasive particles  [5,6,17–19]. 


In  CMP,  mono-dispersity  and  morphology  of  abrasive  particles are  identiﬁed  as  important  factors  which  affect  the  polishing  rates 
[5–11,14].  Some  of  the  signiﬁcant  and  cost  effective  methods  for
synthesis  of  abrasive  particles  including  ceria  are  solvo-thermal method,  sol–gel  method,  self-assembly,  electrochemical  method and  micro-emulsion  method  [4].  However,  mono-dispersity  and

Fig.  1.  (a)  and  (c)  shows  TEM  images  of  SiO2 nanoparticles  synthesized  using  sol–gel  method  and  (b)  and  (d)  shows  SiO2 synthesized  using  microemulsion  method. 


morphology  control  of  larger  ceria  particles  remains  a  challenge since  particle  growth  of  ceria  is  difﬁcult  to  control  [4,12].  Ceria coated  silica  nanoparticle  structures  are  identiﬁed  as  a  successful approach  for  controlling  the  size  and  morphology  of  ceria  abrasive particles  [8,20–24].  In  this  study  we  investigate  synthesis  of  less than  100  nm  pseudo  ceria  particles  by  undertaking  coating  of  ﬁne ceria  particles  over  coarser  silica. 


Synthesis  of  ceria  coated  silica  nanoparticle  enables  modulating selectivity  of  the  CMP   process  to  tap  into  potential  Shallow  Trench Isolation  (STI)  market  [25,26].  The  presently  available/reported  lit- erature  and  information,  on  properties  of  ceria  in  CMP  is  minimal. This  paper  demonstrates  the  synthesis  and  study  of  various  param- eters  inﬂuencing  the  formation  of  ceria  coated  silica  nanoparticles of  size  less  than  100  nm.   CMP   abrasive  slurries  prepared  using  syn- thesized  ceria  coated  silica  nanoparticles  were  used  for  studying SiO2:SiN  polishing  selectivity. 


## 2.  Experimental

## 2.1.  Preparation  of  bare-silica  nanoparticles

A 


popular  and  widely  reported  method  for  silica  nanoparti- cle  synthesis  is  Stober  method  [27].  In  Stober  process,  silicon alkoxides  are  hydrolysed  to  silanols,  which  further  undergoes  con- densation  reaction  to  form  silica  nanoparticles.  There  are  various modiﬁcations  of  this  method  reported  in  the  literature  [27,28]. Both  sol–gel  and  microemulsion  routes  were  used  to  synthesize mono-dispersed  and  spherical  silica  nanoparticles  of  size  less  than 100  nm.   It  was  observed  that  for  particles  less  than  100  nm,   using sol–gel  method,  it  was  difﬁcult  to  control  size  and  shape  of  the  silica nano  particles.  The  resulting  nanoparticles  were  highly  agglomer- ated  with  necking  between  the  individual  nanoparticles  as  shown in  Fig.  1(a)  and  (c).  On  the  other  hand,  using  microemulsion  method 


the  particle  size  and  shape  were  controllable.  The  well  separated nanoparticles  are  shown  in  Fig.  1(b)  and  (d).  In  microemulsion method,  the  surfactant  molecules  dissolved  in  organic  solvents forming  spherical  micelles.  Silica  nanoparticles  are  grown,  inside these  micellar  micro-cavities,  by  controlled  addition  of  silicon alkoxides  and  catalyst  [29,30].  Fig.  1  shows  a  comparison  of  par- ticles  synthesized  using  sol–gel  and  micro-emulsion  methods. 


In  micro-emulsion  method  tetraethyl  orthosilicate  (TEOS)  was used  as  a  source  of  silica,  Triton  X-100  was  used  as  surfactant, cyclohexane  was   the  organic  phase  and  hexanol  was  used  as  co- surfactant  [29].  Addition  of  a  co-surfactant  further  stabilizes  the microemulsion  system  as  it  bridges  the  oil  and  water  interface. 25%  NH4OH  was  used  as  a  catalyst  for  the  reaction.  For  the  syn- thesis,  DI  water  and  ammonia  was  added  to  a  mixture  of  Triton X-100  and  cyclohexane  in  hexanol  under  sonication  followed  by drop  wise  addition  of  TEOS.  The  reactants  were  mixed  for  24  h  dur- ing  which  TEOS  was   hydrolysed  by  NH4OH  to  obtain  silica  particles. The  use  of  surfactant  helps  in  stabilizing  the  emulsion  and  controls the  morphology  of  the  silica  particles  formed.  Upon  completion of  reaction,  ethanol  was  added  to  the  reaction  mixture  to  break the  micro-emulsion  and  release  silica  nanoparticles.  Further  these SiO2 nanoparticles  were  separated  using  centrifugation  method. Collected  particles  were  washed  twice  with  ethanol  and  DI  water. These  particles  were  heated  at  250 ◦C  for  4  h  to  remove  the  surfac- tant  molecules  from  the  surface  before  they  were  further  used  for ceria  coating. 


## 2.2.  Preparation  of  ceria  coated  silica  particles

Mono-dispersed  silica  nanoparticles  synthesized  using  micro- emulsion  methods  were  used  as  a  core  particle  for  further  coating with  CeO2 particles.  Ce(NO3)3 was   used  as  the  source  material to  precipitate  ceria  over  silica  nanoparticles  [4].  As  a  ﬁrst  step

is  used  for  comparison 


Fig.  2(a)  shows  TEM  image  of  silica  particles  separated  from in  this commercial  CMP   slurry,  and study.  Fig.  2(b)  shows  spherical  and  mono-dispersed  silica  par- ticles  synthesized  through  micro-emulsion  method.  The  size  and shape  of  silica  nanoparticles  was   controlled  by  the  size  and shape  of  micro-droplets  of  emulsion  by  varying  the  NH4OH  con- centration  and  use  of  co-surfactant  hexanol.  Fig.  2(c)  and  (d) shows  TEM  images  of  ceria  particles  extracted  from  a  commercial slurry  and  ceria  particles  synthesized  using  precipitation  method respectively. 


During  precipitation  reaction  of  ceria  on  silica  particles,  pH  and temperatures  was  varied,  to  obtain  different  extents  of  ceria  coat- ing  on  silica.  The  precipitation  of  ceria  from  cerium  nitrate  depends on  the  reaction  pH.  Beyond  pH  6,  the  nitrates  undergo  an  exchange reaction  with  hydroxyl  ion  as  shown  in  Eq.  (1).  pH  of  the  precipi- tation  reaction  was   controlled,  by  varying  the  amount  of  NH4OH, and  it  was  observed  that  at  a  lower,  acidic  pH  (3–5),  ceria  forms  a partial  coating  on  silica  at  room  temperature  as  shown  in  Fig.  3(a). For  acidic  pH,  increasing  the  reaction  temperature  from  room  tem- perature  to  95 ◦C  also  resulted  in  partial  coating  of  ceria  on  silica particles  as  in  Fig.  3(b).

Full  coating  of  silica  particles  by  ceria  nanoparticles  as  shown in  Fig.  3(c)  and  (d)  was   achieved  by  increasing  the  pH  of  precipita- tion  reaction  to  a  basic  pH  >  10  and  reaction  temperature  of  95 ◦C. This  can  be  explained  based  on  the  electrostatic  attraction  between ionic  precursor  of  ceria  and  surface  charge  on  silica  particles.  At basic  pH,  the  surface  of  silica  particles  acquire  negative  charge a 


towards  coating,  pre-treated  SiO2 nanoparticle  suspension  in  DI water  was  ball  milled  for  an  hour  to  achieve  de-agglomeration and  dispersion  of  SiO2 nanoparticles.  Cerium  nitrate  solution  was added  to  the  above  dispersion  under  continuous  stirring  followed by  drop  wise  addition  of  NH4OH  solution.  Stirring  was  continued beyond  completion  of  NH4OH  addition  for  the  next  12  h  for  the reaction  to  keep  progressing.  In  order  to  achieve  complete  coating of  ceria  over  silica  core  particles  the  pH  (4–10)  and  temperature (50 ◦C–95 ◦C)  of  the  ceria  precipitation  reaction  was   varied.  Ceria coated  silica  nanoparticles  were  separated  by  centrifugation followed  by  washing  repeatedly  with  de-ionized  water  to  remove any  possible  ionic  remnants. 


## 2.3.  Polishing  experiments

Polishing  tests  were  carried  out  on  Ecomet  4+  Automet  pol- ishing  machine  manufactured  by  Buehler  using  groove  pads  made of  polyurethane.  The  rotation  speed  of  the  pad  was  set  at  80  rpm with  an  applied  downward  load  of  15  lbs  and  a  constant  slurry ﬂow  rate  of  100  ml/min  was  maintained.  The  polishing  slurries were  prepared  by  dispersing  silica  nanoparticles,  ceria  nanopar- ticles  and  ceria  coated  silica  nanoparticles  separately  in  aqueous medium  with  additives  and  was  mixed  on  a  roller  miller.  Film thickness  reduction  of  polished  Si  wafers  was  determined  using  an optical  ellipsometer  (JOBIN-YVON  SPEX).  Structural  analysis  of  the ceria  coated  silica  nanoparticles  was  carried  out  using  TEM  (Philips CM  200  keV)  and  it  was  compared  to  particles  used  in  prepara- tion  of  commercial  slurries.  X-ray  diffractometer  (XRD;  Bruker D8-advance,  Karlsruhe,  Germany)  was  used  to  carry  out  the  phase analysis  of  the  nanoparticles.  Synthesized  particles  were  charac- terized  by  FTIR  to  study  the  coating  and  surface  functional  groups. Surface  charge  of  these  particles  was  analyzed  using  zeta  potential measurements.

and  the  strong  electrostatic  attraction  between  negatively  charged silica  surface  and  the  positively  charged  ceria  precursor  leads  to better  coating  of  ceria  on  silica  [4].  At  an  acidic  pH,  the  poor  cov- erage  of  ceria  on  silica  particles  is  observed  using  SEM  imaging shown  in  Fig.  3(a)  and  (b)  and  XRD  analysis  as  shown  in  Fig.  4. Fig.  3(c)  and  (d)  represents  the  batch  of  particles  from  the  opti- mized  reaction  process  in  which  ceria  forms  a  complete  coating on  silica  particles.  The  pH  of  the  process  was   maintained  at  10 for  effective  coating  of  ceria  over  silica.  A  post  annealing  of  ceria coated  silica  particles  (reaction  conditions:  pH  >  10,  95 ◦C  temper- ature)  at  150 ◦C  was  undertaken  for  2  h  to  enhance  the  adhesion  of ceria  on  to  the  silica  core.  The  coated  particle  size  was  determined ∼70–80  nm  through  SEM  and  TEM  analysis.

shows  that  the  isoelectric  point  (IEP)  for  ceria  coated  silica  particles approaches  that  of  ceria,  emphasizing  stable  coated  nanoparticle structure  formation  by  precipitation  method  [4].  FTIR  spectra  of the  synthesized  samples  of  bare  silica,  ceria  and  ceria  coated  sil- ica  are  provided  in  Fig.  7.  For  bare  silica,  the  band  at  1085  cm−1 is  assigned  to  the  asymmetrical  stretching  vibrations  of  Si–O–Si and  the  band  at  965  cm−1due  to  the  Si–O  stretching  vibrations.  For bare  ceria,  weak  band  at  533  cm−1 corresponds  to  the  Ce–O  stretch- ing.  The  broad  and  intense  peaks  for  all  samples  at  3400  cm−1and 1630  cm−1 corresponds  to  the  O–H  stretching  and  scissor  bending

Polishing  experiments  were  carried  out  on  thermally  grown silicon  oxide  and  nitride  ﬁlms  on  silicon  wafers  (Noel  Technolo- gies,  Campbell,  CA)  and  were  polished  on  a  Buehler  Phoenix-beta polisher  using  IC-1400K  Groove  pads  made  of  polyurethane  (Rodel Inc.,  Phoenix,  AZ).  Before  each  experiment,  the  polishing  pad  was conditioned  for  1  min   with  a  diamond  grit  conditioner  using  de- ionized  water.  The  aqueous  polishing  slurry  (1  wt%)  was   sonicated for  30  min   and  was  placed  on  a  roller  miller  to  maintain  good dispersion.  The  pH  of  slurry  before  polishing  was   measured  and maintained  at  pH-5  at  which  the  silicon  oxide  wafer  and  the  ceria particles  will  be  oppositely  charged  and  thus  improving  interac- tion  between  wafers  and  particles.  For  pH  >  5  the  particle  settling rate  was  found  to  be  higher  and  ceria  coated  silica  slurry  was  found to  be  unstable  at  basic  pH.  This  observation  is  similar  to  that  of bare  ceria  particle  slurry  showing  increased  particle  agglomeration and  reduced  removal  rates  and  stability  for  ceria  slurry  at  basic  pH (pH  >  7)  [1,11]. 


The  polishing  rates  for  SiO2 and  SiN  wafers  were  determined from  the  differences  of  the  ﬁlm  thicknesses  measured  by  ellipsome- try  technique  [13].  Selective  polishing  ratio  of  12  was  observed  for SiO2:SiN  wafers  using  ceria  coated  silica  particles  prepared  under different  conditions.  The  polishing  mechanism  is  explained  as  fol- lows.  When  ceria  abrasive  particles  come  in  contact  with  the  silica surface,  a  chemical  bond  forms  between  the  ceria  particle  and  sil- ica  surface  as  shown  in  Eq.  (2).  Further,  strained  Ce–O–Si  bond ruptures  at  the  weaker  Si–O  bond  due  to  the  mechanical  motion during  CMP   and  is  removed  as  silicic  acid  (Si(OH)4)  in  aqueous slurry.

A 


study  of  particles  collected  from  used  slurries  after  the  polish- ing  experiments  revealed  that  ceria  coated  over  silica  at  pH  10  and 95 ◦C  reaction  temperature  had  better  adherence  with  core-silica. This  is  indicated  by  almost  no  change  in  XRD  peaks  and  structure observed  under  TEM  as  shown  in  Fig.  8.  Fig.  8(a)  and  (b)  respec- tively  shows  ceria  coated  silica  prepared  at  pH  4.5  before  and  after polishing.  It  was  observed  that  for  particles  prepared  at  pH  4.5, ceria  coating  was  removed  from  the  silica  surface  after  the  polish- ing  experiment.  Whereas  ceria  coated  silica  nanoparticles  prepared at  pH  10  before  polishing  as  shown  in  Fig.  8(c)  and  after  polish- ing  as  shown  in  Fig.  8(d)  show  better  adherence  of  ceria  on  silica core. 


## 4.  Conclusions

This  study  demonstrates  synthesis  of  highly  spherical  and mono-dispersed,  ceria  coated  silica  nanoparticles  for  application as  abrasive  particles  in  selective  CMP.  Coating  of  ceria  over  sil- ica  was  done  using  precipitation  method.  Precipitation  reactions were  carried  out  by  varying  the  pH  and  reaction  temperature.  A uniform  and  adherent  coating  of  ceria  over  silica  was  obtained  for reaction  carried  out  at  95 ◦C  at  pH  10.  Coating  of  ceria  over  sil- ica  and  dispersion  properties  were  studied  using  TEM,  EDX,  XRD and  zeta-potential  analyses,  and  the  results  show  formation  of stable  and  dispersed  ceria  coated  silica  nanoparticles  of  size  less than  100  nm.   These  uniform  and  spherical  nanoparticles  structures are  excellent  substitutes  for  coarser  ceria  abrasive  particles.  When used  as  an  abrasive  material  in  polishing  slurry,  these  less  than 100  nm  nanoparticles  particles  considerably  reduce  the  solid  load- ing  in  the  formulated  CMP   slurry.  Polishing  results  achieved  so  far shows  improvement  in  selectivity  between  SiO2 and  SiN  wafers using  1  wt%  nanoparticles  particle  slurry  with  maximum  selective removal  rate  of  12.
