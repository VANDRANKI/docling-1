# Abstract

A  nano-cerium  dioxide  hydrosol  was  synthesized  via  a  sol–gel  process  at  the  range  of  room  temperature  to  65  8C  with  the  nonionic  surfactant PVP  (polyvinylpyrrolidone).  The  mixture  solution  of  cerium  nitrate  and  urea  turned  out  a  visible  chemical  reaction  under  the  catalysis  of  ammonia. The  X-ray  diffraction  (XRD),  transmission  electron  microscopy  (TEM),  and  X-ray  photoelectron  spectroscopy  (XPS)  analyses  indicated  the colloidal  ingredient  and  nano-crystal  structural  information.  The  colloid  was  crystalline  face-centered  cubic  nano-structured  cerium  dioxide.  The sizes  of  CeO2 colloids  are  in  the  range  of  several  nanometers  to  10  nm  or  more.  The  application  of  the  hydrosol  may  focus  on  the  ceria-based polishing  agent  for  chemical  mechanical  polishing  (CMP)  process. # 2011  Elsevier  Ltd  and  Techna  Group  S.r.l.

## 1.  Introduction

Cerium  dioxide  is  one  of  the  most  important  rare-earth oxide,  of  which  application  ﬁelds  include  industrial  catalysts 
[1,2],  solid  oxide  fuel  cells  (SOFC)  [3,4],  polishing  abrasive

[5,6]  and  other  ﬁelds.  Especially,  CeO2 polishing  abrasive  for
STI-CMP  (Shallow  Trench  Isolation  Chemical  Mechanical Polishing)  has  been  received  widely  attention  in  recent  years due its  excellent  selectivity  and  efﬁciency.  To  satisfy polishing  requirements,  a  variety  of  cerium  oxide  synthesis methods  have  been  extensively  studied  to  increase  cerium dioxide  performance  in  STI-CMP  process,  such  as  precipita- tion,  sol–gel,  hydrothermal,  physical  chemistry,  and  high- energy  dispersion. 


to 


As  we  known,  the  commercial  abrasive  particles  are  usually prepared  by  means  of  calcination,  gas  combustion  or  high- energy  ball  milling  dispersion,  easily  leading  to  irregular  shape, severe  agglomeration,  uneven  distribution  of  particles.  These disadvantages  resulted  in  the  scratches  and  defects  of  polished surface,  and  limited  the  CeO2 abrasive  further  application  in  the decreasing  feature  size  of  integrated  circuits  in  the  semi- conductor  industry. 


In 


to  replace  CeO2-calcinated this  paper,  we  proposed abrasive  with  CeO2-colloid  abrasive reduce polishing  defects.  Otherwise,  the  synthesized  colloids  should be  crystalline  ceria  to  keep  its  high  polishing  selectivity.

increased 


The  synthesis  process  was  similar  to  the  reference  [7,8].  The details  were  described  as  follows  (Fig.  1):  cerium  source Ce(NO3)3(cid:2)6H2O,  buffer  CO(NH2)2 and  dispersant  PVP  were dissolved  into  a  certain  amount  of  deionized  water  with  a magnetic  stirrer.  The the  mixture  solution temperature  of gradually set to room from temperature,  and  the  solution  should  be  kept  stirring  for  1  h. Then,  an  appropriate  amount  of  ammonia  was  added  dropwise with  a  burette.  The  reaction  quickly  happened  within  a  few seconds,  and  the  solution  color  underwent  obviously  change  in few  hours.  The  phenomenon  of  color  change  was  believed  to  be correlated  with  the  chemical  changes.  As  the  color  of  reaction solution  turned  from  purple  into  pale  yellow,  the  Ce3+ happened to  be  oxidized  into  Ce4+ by  O2 under  air  atmosphere.  The  possible chemical  reaction  is  stated  as  the  following  formulas  [9]:

## 3.  Results  and  discussion

In  order  to  conﬁrm  the  possible  compound  in  the  powder sample  for  researching  the  actual  reaction  process,  the  sample was  dried  at  room  temperature  in  the  semi-closed  crucible  for several  days.  The  dried  powder  showed  pale  yellow,  as  the  same color  as  the  sol.  Fig.  2  shows  the  TG–DSC  curves  of  the  dried powder. 


The  TG–DSC  patterns  (in  Fig.  2)  showed 


the  thermal behavior  from  room  temperature  up  to  500  8C.  The  mass  loss can  be  divided  into  four  stages:  The  weight  loss  below  140  8C

solution  could  not  keep its  suspension  state  and  formed precipitation  totally.  Fig.  6  shows  the  TEM  images  of  two  kinds of  cerium  concentration  samples.  It  could  be  found  that  each colloid  was  consisted  of  several  10-nm-size  crystal  particles, and  ceria  colloids  were  not  monodispersed  actually.  The  CeO2 colloids  obtained  from  the  solution  of  0.05  mol  L(cid:3)1 cerium  (a) possessed  a  better  dispersion  performance that  of 


than 


was  due  to  the  removal  of  physisorbed  water.  Decomposition  of the  structural  water  was  in  between  140  8C  and  215  8C.  The loss  from  215  8C  to  305  8C  was  attributed  to  the weight decomposition  of  a  side  product  of  cerium  oxycarbonate  [7], corresponding  to  a  sharp  exothermic  peak  at  291  8C  in  the  DTA curve.  The  exothermic  peak  around  450  8C  might  be  caused  by the  oxidation  of  cerium  compound.  So,  it  could  be  concluded that  the  synthesized  product  contained  not  only  ceria  but  also some  other  materials. 


As  we  know,  the  crystal  structure  of  pure  ceria  is  a  face- centered  cubic  structure,  grouped  into  the  calcium  ﬂuoride (CaF2)  structural  type  with  space  group  Fm3m.  The  XRD pattern  of  the  dried  ceria  colloids  (Fig.  3)  showed  a  good agreement  with  literature  data  (JCPDS  No.  34-0394).  The  main Bragg  peaks  with  Miller  indices  (1  1  1),  (2  0  0),  (2  2  0),  (3  1  1), (2  2  2),  and  (4  0  0)  could  be  found  clearly.  The  pure  crystallized ceria  could  be  obtained  at  lower  temperature. 


Fig.  4  depicts  the  XPS  spectrum  of  the  CeO2 nanoparticles. Peaks  of  Ce  3d  and  O  1s  proved  the  existence  of  cerium  oxide. Ce  3d  binding  energy  (BE)  peaks  were  consistent  with  that  of Ce4+ ions.  The  band  at  918.1  eV  should  be  one  of  the  3d104f0 state  of  the  Ce4+ ions  [10,11],  compared  with  the  band  of 916.5  eV  BE  in  the  reference  [12],  the  upward  shift  of  binding energy  value  may  be  due  to  smaller  particle  size.  Here,  the software  of  XPSPEAK41  was  used  to  mark  and  ﬁt  the  Ce  3d peaks.The  aqueous  solution  with  concentration  of  0.1  mol  L(cid:3)1 cerium  was  adopted  for  synthesis  of  ceria  colloids.  The  content of  PVP  was  30  g  L(cid:3)1.  The  TEM  images  of  ceria  colloids synthesized  at  different  temperatures  for  72  h  are  shown  in Fig.  5.  Obviously,  the  sample  synthesized  at  25  8C  had  severe colloid  agglomeration the  sample synthesized  at  65  8C  (Fig.  5(b))  indicated  a  better  dispersing behavior.  Lower  temperature  might  restrain  the  dispersion effect  of  PVP  so  that  leaded  to  a  bad  dispersion  performance.  It means  that  the  dispersion  effect  of  PVP  requires  a  proper temperature. 


(Fig.  5(a)).  However, 


Generally,  the  content  of  ceria  colloids  in  the  solution depends  on in  reaction the  concentration  of  cerium  salt precursor.  In  the  study,  the  samples  with  different  cerium contents  were  synthesized  to  conﬁrm  the  limit  concentration  of ceria  hydrosol.  The  experimental  results  shown:  with  increas- ing  concentration  of  cerium the precipitation  started  to  appear  gradually.  When  the  concentra- tion  of  cerium  reached  up  to  0.2  mol  L(cid:3)1,  the  colloids  in  the 


solution,

0.1  mol  L(cid:3)1 cerium  (b).  The  experimental  facts  indicated  the stability  of  ceria  hydrosol  is  relative  to  the  concentration  of cerium  salt. 


Fig.  7(a)–(c)  shows  TEM  images  of  the  samples  prepared  at different  reaction  times.  It  could  be  seen  that  the  effect  of reaction  time  on  crystallinity  of  ceria  is  obvious.  With  increase of  reaction  time,  the  reciprocal  lattice  of  patterns  became  more and  more  evident,  which  proved  a  well-crystallized  ceria.  Size of  the  ceria  colloids  not  changed  obviously  with  increase  of reaction  time. 


Ceria  particles  are  easy  to  form  aggregation.  To  verify  the stability  of  cerium  oxide  hydrosol,  the  sample  stored  three months  was  measured  by  TEM.  The  colloids  had  no  signiﬁcant further  agglomeration  compared  with  fresh  sample  (similar  to Fig.  7).  The  hydrosol  is  stable  enough  for  application. 


## 4.  Conclusions

Well-dispersed  ceria  hydrosol  was  obtained  via  the  sol–gel process  at  65  8C.  The  ceria  colloids  possessed  face-centered cubic  CaF2 structure.  The  grain  size  is  in  the  range  of  several nanometers  to  more  than  10  nm.  The  hydrosol  also  exhibited  a good  aging  stability  in  three  months.
