Preparation  of  ceria-based  polishing powders  from  carbonates 


P.  JANOS,  M.  PETRlkK Research Institute of Inorganic Chemistry, 400 60  Ost( nad Labem, Czechoslovakia 


The  preparation  of  Ce0v)  oxide-based  polishing  powders  by thermal  decomposition  of carbonates  was studied  and  the  effect  of the  calcination  process conditions  on  the  properties of  product  was examined.  High-grade  polishing  powders  can  be  produced  at calcination temperatures  700-1  200~ the  maximum  polishing  efficiency  is achieved  by  calcining  at 1 000-11 00 ~  The  observed  dependences  were  interpreted  from  the  standpoint  of  the  present mechanochemical  theory  of  glass polishing. 


## 1.  I n t r o d u c t i o n

Polishing  powders  based  on  cerium  oxide  are  reck- oned  among  the  most  efficient and  most  widely used means for polishing glass  1,  2.  As may be  seen from the  designation,  the  active  constituent  of this  type  of polishing agents is cerium (IV) oxide but normally non- negligible  amounts  of  oxides  of  the  other  rare  earth elements (La203, Nd203,  etc.) may be present as well. The presence of these oxides, however, does not reduce the efficiency of the polishing powders (providing that the  content  of CeO z remains  higher than  about  45% -3),  which is due to the formation of ceria-based solid solutions  4. 


The  respective  oxides  are  prepared  by  a  thermal decomposition  of oxalates,  hydroxides  or  carbonates of the  rare  earth  elements (REE)  2,  3.  The course  of the calcination process influences in a decisive way the properties  of  a  polishing  agent.  Dependences of  the polishing  efficiency (and,  in  sporadic  cases,  of  other characteristics)  on  the  conditions  of calcination  were measured during the thermal decomposition of oxala- tes  and  hydroxides  of  REE  2,  3,  5  and,  less  fie, quently,  of REE  carbonates  6. 


In  addition  to  polishing  efficiency polishing  pow- ders are characterized by a number of other properties such as bulk density, granulometric composition, spe- cific  surface  area,  pH  of  aqueous  extract,  aqueous suspension  stability,  and  others  2,  3,  7.  Until  re- cently  there  has  not  been  established  any  explicit correlation  among  these  characteristics  (or  other physical  quantities)  and  the  polishing  efficiency of  a polishing  powder  except  for  some  rules  formulated generally  by  Kaller  -8,  9.  One  reason  for  this  situ- ation  is  the  comparatively  complex  nature  of  the process  of mechanical  polishing  of glass  that  has  not yet been  elucidated  in  detail. 


The  theories  explaining the  mechanism  of the  poli- shing  process  may  be  divided  into  three  groups:  (i) microabrasion  theory,  regarding  polishing  as  con- tinuation  of the  process  of grinding on  a  micro-scale; (ii) the theory of thermal softening and creeping of the surface of glass; and (iii) chemical theories of polishing. 


Nowadays  it  may  be  taken  as  proven  that  in  the course  of glass  polishing  both  physical  and  chemical processes  are  taking  place. 


The  polishing  efficiency depends  to  a  high  degree both  on  the  dynamic  conditions  during  polishing (velocity, pressure)  and on chemical conditions (pH  of the  suspension  of  a  polishing  powder,  presence  of chemical  accelerators,  etc.)  10,  11. 


In  the  present  work  we  were  concerned  with  the preparation  of  ceria-based  polishing  powders  from carbonate  precursors.  We  studied  the  effect of calcin- ation  on  the  polishing efficiency and  other  character- istics of the polishing agents and attempted to find out the  correlations  among  the  measured  quantities  and to interpret them from the standpoint of today's mech- ano-chemical  theory  of glass  polishing. 


## 2.  Experimental  procedure

## 2.1.  Preparation  of  polishing  powders

Three  series  of polishing  powders  were  prepared: 


Series A:  The  raw material was reagent-grade cerium (ni)  nitrate Series  B:  The  raw  material  was  a  cerium-containing fraction as  obtained  from a  bastnasite  concentrate by extraction  with  tributylphosphate. Series  C:  The  raw  material  was  a  cerium-containing fraction as obtained from a  REE concentrate from the Kola  apatite  by  conventional  processes  -  selective precipitation  and  dissolving. 


The  above  starting  materials  were  used  for  the preparation  of nitrate  solutions  at  the  concentration of  0.2 m o l d m -  3  of  REE  and  0.1 mol d m -  3  of  free nitric  acid.  The  respective  REE  carbonates  were  pre- cipitated from these solutions by a  gaseous mixture of carbon  dioxide and  ammonia. The  precipitation  took the procedure has been described in place at  30-35  ~ greater  detail The precipitate  was  separated  by  filtration  and  dried  at 110~  Thus  prepared  carbonates  did  not  have  an exactly  defined  composition,  they  were  a  mixture  of

normal,  basic  and  oxo  carbonates.  Using  the  X-ray diffraction  analysis  a  crystal  phase  of  the  Ce20- (CO3)z-nH20  type  was  identified.  Besides,  further unidentified  crystalline  and  amorphous  components were  present  (see  Fig.  1). 


Samples  of  polishing  powders  were  prepared  by calcining the REE  carbonates  in an  open crucible in a muffle  furnace  under  controlled  conditions  (temper- ature,  time). 


Chemical  composition  of  the  prepared  polishing 


powders  is  given  in  Table  I. 


## 2.2.  Measuring  methods

The  polishing  efficiency of polishing  powders  may be assessed in  accordance  with  two  aspects:  (a) the  qual- ity of the  polished  surface of glass,  and  (b) the  rate  at which  the  mass  of glass  is  being  removed. 


The degree of the glass surface roughness was evalu- ated  with  the  aid  of  a  microprofile  meter  Hommel Tester  T-20.  This  instrument,  however,  enables  only greater  unevenesses  to  be measured.  At  present  there

is  no  objective  method  available  for  measuring  the unevenesses of a well polished glass surface.  In keeping with  practice,  the  quality  of polishing  was,  therefore, evaluated  visually. 


The  rate  of glass  removal  was  assessed gravimetri- 


cally in  accordance  with  the  relation 


r  =  m/(Sgtppg) 


(1) 


where r is the linear  rate of glass removal, m the loss in weight  of  glass  in  the  course  of  polishing,  Sg  the surface area  of polished  glass,  tp the  time  of polishing and  9g  the  density  of glass.  The  measurements  were conducted  on  a  polishing  machine  K/irger. 


The  particle  size  distribution  was  measured  by  the photosedimentation  method  using  a  centrifugal  par- ticle  size  analyser  Shimadzu  SA  CP-2.  Based  on  the Rosin-Rammler-Sperling-Bennet  (RRSB) distribution the  particle  size  characteristic  xa and  grain  size expo- nent  n  were calculated.  It  holds 


R(x)  =  1 0 0 e x p - 


(x/xd)" 


R(xa)  =  100/e 


(2) 


(3) 


where  e is  the  basis  of natural  logarithms  (2.718) and R(x)  is  the  weight  per  cent  of particles  whose  size  is equal  or  larger  than  x. 


The value of the apparent  or "outer" specific surface area  Sv  was  calculated  from  the  RRSB  distribution characteristics 


Sv  =  (  kn  ~  Cexp(  x)nx"-2dx 


\ppxd/  J 


(4) 


where  k  is  the  shape  factor  and  )p  the  density  of the polishing  powder. 


The  X-ray  diffraction  measurements  were  carried out  on  a  Philips  PW  1140  spectrometer.  The  size  of crystallites  was  calculated  from  the  diffraction  lines broadening  according  to  the  Sherrer  formula  13 


a  =  KZ./13cos  0 


(5) 


where  K  is  the  shape  factor,  X the  wavelength  of the applied  radiation,  13 the  broadening  of the  diffraction line,  and  0  the  diffraction  angle.  The  procedure  of measuring  the  cerium  oxide  crystallites  size  is  de- scribed  in  a  greater  detail  elsewhere,  for  example,  in 14. 


Besides,  specific  surface  area  Ss  of  the  polishing powders  was  measured  by  the  dynamic  sorption method  with  the  aid  of a  Geotest instrument  (VI~IEK, Hradec  Krfilov6,  Czechoslovakia). 


The methods of assessing the properties of polishing powders  have  been  described  in  more  detail  in  our previous  paper  7. 


## 3.  Results  and  discussion

The dependence of the polishing efficiency of polishing powders (expressed as linear  rate  of glass removal) on temperature  and time of calcination is shown in Fig.  2. It may be seen that  the effect of calcination  time on the polishing  efficiency  is considerably lower than  that  of polishing  temperature.  The  dependences  of the  poli- shing removal rate  on calcination  temperature  exhibit

a  number  of intermediate  products  15,  17,  18.  Ac- cording  to  Savin  et  al.  16 the  decomposition  and oxidation  of  Ce(ut)  carbonates  are  complete  at  the temperature  of  460~ however, demonstrated  that  Ce(m) was  present even in  samples calcined  at  500 ~  Hence  it  seems  that  preparations calcined  at  temperatures  lower  than  roughly  700~ contain some intermediate products of the decomposi- tion  that  have  a  marked  negative  effect  upon  the polishing  properties.

The values of the  specific surface area  Ss in  samples of the  A  and  C  series  were  measured  by  the  sorption method;  the  obtained  dependences  (Fig.  4)  are  of similar  character  as  those  assessed  when  studying  the or thermal  decomposition  of cerium(m)  oxalate  19 hydroxide  16.  Besides,  the  particle  size  distribution of the  samples  was  measured  and  the  values  of appar- ent  specific  surface  area  Sv  were  calculated  from  the RRSB  distribution  characteristics.  The  values  of" S v and  Ss differ considerably  and  the  differences cannot be attributed  only to deviations of the real shape of the particles  from  a  spherical  form  as  presumed  in  the calculation  of  Sv.  It  is  necessary  to  assume  that  the polishing  agent  particles  have  a  more  complex microporous  -  character.  The  ratio  Sv/S~  may  be regarded  as  a  measure  of compactness  or  mechanical resistance of the  particles  20.  The dependence of the ratio  Sv/Ss  on  temperature  of calcination  is  also  dem- onstrated  in  Fig.  4.

the  maximum  in  the  temperature  range  of  roughly 1000-1100 ~  A  steep  decline  in  the  polishing  effici- ency  begins  when  the  calcination  temperature  de- creases to below 700 ~  and, at  the same  time, also  the polished  surface  quality  deteriorates  markedly. 


In  Fig.  3  is  demonstrated  the  dependence  of  the removal  rate  and  glass  surface  roughness  o n   the time  of  calcin- calcination  temperature  (300-800~ ation  1 h). When  samples  of polishing agents prepared at  lower  temperatures  are  used,  not  only  the  removal rate  is  low  but  so  is  also  the  quality  of  the  polished surface,  and  this  .is  true  even  in  the  cases  when  the glass  was  previously polished  with  some  other,  high- grade  polishing  agent.  Scratches  and,  particularly, defects of the "orange skin" type appear on the treated surface,  witnessing  a  chemical  attack  on  the  glass surface. 


The  X-ray  diffraction  patterns  of polishing  agents samples as prepared by the calcination at  300 ~  show that  only cerium(w)  oxide is present.  See Fig.  1 (com- pare  e.g.  15,  16). It  has  been  known  that  the  de- composition of Ce(In) carbonates is a complex process accompanied by oxidation of cerium and  formation of

The dependences obtained make it possible to inter- pret, at  least  qualitatively, the correlation between the polishing efficiency (rate of glass  removal) and  temper- ature  of calcination. 


It  has  been  known  that  both  the  mechanical  and chemical  aspects  play  a  role  in  the  polishing  process. Let  us  assume  for  simplicity  that  the  overall  rate  of removal r  is a sum of the mechanical (rm) and chemical (Q) actions. The contribution of the mechanical  action is proportional to mechanical resistance of particles of the  respective  polishing  agent,  i.e.  to  the  Sv/Ss  ratio. The  chemical  contribution  depends  on  the  polishing agent  ability  to  create  new,  chemically active surfaces in the course of the polishing process. It is, therefore, a function of the crystal lattice order (size of crystallites, number  of crystal  lattice  defects).  When  we  calculate the  value  of specific surface  area  Su  according to 


Su  =  constant/a 


(6) 


(where  a  is  the  size  of  crystallites  and  the  constant incorporates  the  shape  factor  and  polishing  agent density),  Su  may  be  considered  specific  surface  area "utilizable" for polishing and re is then proportional to this  specific surface  area  S~. 


The  dependence  of  r m on  calcination  temperature has a  similar shape as the dependence for Sv/Ss (Fig. 4), the dependence of r~ on  calcination  temperature  has a similar  character  as  the  curves  1 and  2  in  Fig.  5.  The curves are shown  schematically in  Fig.  6. The shape  of the  cumulative  curve  rm +  r~  corresponds  to  experi- mentally ascertained  dependence  Of the  glass  removal rate  on  the  temperature  of calcination  (Fig.  2). 


Based  on  the  results  of  laboratory  investigations conditions for the preparation of polishing powders in a  pilot  plant  scale  were  specified.  In  spite  of  the  fact that  the  process  of  calcination  was  carried  out  in  a different type of equipment  (rotary kiln), good  quality polishing  powders  were  produced  whose  properties did  not  differ substantially  from  those  of the  laborat- ory  samples  as  prepared  in  a  muffle  furnace  (see Table  II).

Good  quality  polishing  powders  can  be  prepared  by thermal  decomposition of cerium (n 0  carbonate (or in a  mixture  with  a  certain  amount  of  other  REE)  at temperatures  ranging  from  700  to  1200 ~  The  high- est  rate  of glass  removal  was  observed  with  samples prepared  at  1000-1100 ~  Although  the  rates  of  re- moval  achieved  with  polishing  agents  made  at  700 ~ and  at  1200 ~  are  virtually  the  same,  the  mechanism of  the  process  of  polishing  obviously  is  somewhat different  in  these  two  cases,  which  may  affect  the properties  of  the  polished  surface  of  glass  (chemical resistance,  rate  of ageing,  etc.).  An  experience  known in  the  practice  has  been  confirmed:  polishing  agents with  high  removal rate  produce also polished  surfaces of good  quality,  and  vice  versa.  Besides  the  polishing efficiency the  temperature  of polishing  affects primar- ily the  value  of the  specific surface  area  Ss and  size  of
