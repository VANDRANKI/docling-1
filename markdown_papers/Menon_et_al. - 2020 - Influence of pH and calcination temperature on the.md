Ceria particles  are now extensively used  in chemical mechanical  polishing of glass,  which makes them a  promising material for  semiconductor  industry.  In  this  work,  a  facile  co-precipitation  route  was  adopted  to  synthesis  ceria  particles.  Cerium  ni- trate hexahydrate and sodium carbonate were used as the precursors. Study of the effect of  pH and calcination temperature on synthesized ceria particles were carried out in detail. The  surface morphology was found to be  influenced significantly by change  in  solution  pH,  as  evinced  from  SEM  results.  XRD  spectra  revealed  improvement  in  crystallite  size  for  synthesized nanoceria calcined at different temperatures.

# Introduction

Ceria is a rare earth material having face centered cubic fluorite structure1. In recent years’ ceria as a nanoparticle have gained wide attentiveness in research domain. Because, unlike their bulk counterparts, they possess captivating im- manent physical and chemical properties2. Immense poten- tial uses of ceria have been observed as an outcome of bur- geoning academic interest on them. Some salient applica- tions being: as an electrolyte material for solid oxide fuel cells (SOFC), as sunscreen for ultraviolet absorbents, in oxy- gen sensors, as ceramic pigments, as catalytic wet oxida- tion material and for photocatalytic oxidation of water3. Cur- rently  both  industrial  and  academic  focus  on  ceria nanoparticles are deeply rooted to their use as an abrasive in silicon substrate chemical mechanical polishing (CMP) and modern automotive engine exhaust catalyst4. 


Prescience behind the promising nature of nanoceria and nanoceria based  compounds, with different properties for different applications, emerged with a large number of con- ventional and novel methods for its synthesis. These meth- ods include precipitation, hydrothermal, sono-chemical, so- lution combustion, ultra-sonic spray pyrolysis and hydroxide mediated approach5. Selection of proper techniques depends on both the required specific properties and accessibility of reagent chemicals6. Among  these  methods, owing to  its 


comparably simpler, inexpensive nature and easy scale-up, precipitation method has gained ample attention7. Chen et al. synthesized nanoceria by precipitation using cerium ni- trate and ammonia as precursors to evaluate the effect of reaction temperature and atmosphere on its characteristics8. Liu et al. prepared nanoceria particles about 200 nm size with cerium sulphate and oxalic acid as precursors9. Cerium nitrate, potassium carbonate and potassium hydroxide were used as precursors by Farahmandjou et al. to synthesis ce- rium oxide nanoparticles via co-precipitation route5. Cerium precursors in nitrate form are reported to be most preferred for producing nanoceria particles with uniform size10. Most literatures on precipitation technique were evolving around influence of  cerium  precursors, additives,  reaction  atmo- sphere and ligands7. Whilst very few reported works are avail- able on effects of  pH and calcination temperature.  In this paper, a facile co-precipitation method to synthesize cerium oxide nanoparticles is reported. Further the influence of pH on morphology  and calcination temperature  on crystallite growth of prepared particles was investigated with the aid of SEM, EDS and XRD. 


Experimental 


Cerium nitrate hexahydrate (Ce (NO3)3.6H2O: 99.9%) and sodium carbonate (Na2CO3: anhydrous 99.5%: extra pure) were purchased from Loba Chemie.

Requisite amount of cerium nitrate and sodium carbon- ate precursors were weighed precisely and dissolved in 250 mL of water. Then the freshly prepared 0.1 M cerium nitrate and 0.15 M sodium carbonate aqueous solutions were added drop by drop to 100 mL of well stirred distilled water simulta- neously in required quantity. Precipitation of cerous carbon- ate occurs immediately and much more progressively. There- upon, the solution was parted to three. NaOH/nitric acid was added to adjust the pH of solutions to acidic (5), neutral (7) and alkaline (9). Solutions were then dried for 2 h at 80ºC in a hot air oven and brought to room temperature. Without any purification, solutions were aged in a muffle furnace for 2.5 h at 230ºC. Finally, the sample was calcined at 600ºC for 3 h to produce ceria nanoparticles. XRD analysis of the sample was carried out with 2 in range 20–90º (scan rate: 3.5º/min) using PANalytical 3Kw Xpert Powder XRD to identify crystal- line size and phase. The morphology of prepared nanoceria was characterised by SEM with type ZEISS EVO-18. Elemen- tal composition was studied using EDS (INCA 250 EDS). 


Results  and  discussion 


Influence of pH: 


Fig. 1 evinces the SEM images of ceria particles synthe- sized at different pH values. The significant effect of solute environment in  defining  the  surface  morphology of grains was reported in most of the existing literatures11. At acidic condition (Fig. 1a), softly agglomerated small crystallites were observed. Ceria nanoparticle tends to aggregate and evolve 


into an irregular complex mixture of spherical and rod like assembly at neutral environment12 (Fig. 1b). Clearly defined cubical flake like morphology of nanoceria aggregates (Fig. 1c) were found in alkaline pH. This can be attributed to the effect of nucleation of nanoparticles. Elemental composition of nanoceria synthesized at different pH was affirmed by EDS results as reported in Table 1.

Fig. 2 revealed the XRD morphology of nanoceria par- ticles prepared at different pH conditions. Spectra peaks at 28.5º, 33.1º, 47º, 56.3º, 69.5º, 76.7º and 79.1º corresponds to (111), (200), (220), (311), (222), (400), (331), (420) and (422) respectively of cerium oxide with fluorite cubic struc- ture. Crystallite diameter and average crystallite size is re- ported in Table 2. A decline in average crystallite size with rise  in pH of solute  environment was  observed. This is in congruence with existing literatures11,13.

On increasing the temperature, peaks become sharper along with an addition of five more peaks at (222), (400), (331), (420) and (422). This gives a plausible reason for the rise in crystallization. According to Debye-Sherrer equation10:

line nature of as-synthesized particles as shown in Fig. 3. Each  sample  evinces  distinctive  peaks corresponding to (111), (200), (220), (311) planes which closely confirms to fluorite structured CeO2 crystal. Prior to calcination, broad XRD peaks were observed at (111), (200), (220) and (311).

crystallite size of the synthesized ceria particles at each cal- cination temperature has been estimated. Table 3 summa- rizes the crystallite diameter and average crystallite size cor- responding to calcination temperature. In general, crystallite size is deliberated using the strong peak, while the average crystallite size is deliberated using all the peaks obtained in the XRD spectra13. With the increase in calcination tempera- ture, a  proliferating  trend can be observed in both the re- sults. Small crystallite sizes  prior to and at low calcination temperatures can be attributed to high porosity and inter- connection between the pores14. Network of continuous par- ticle boundaries have been able to be formed at higher tem- peratures by linking of fine particles, thus improving the size of crystals10.

# Conclusions

Ceria particles were synthesised successfully by adopt- ing a facile co-precipitation  route using cerium nitrate and sodium carbonate as precursors. XRD results ascertained the cubic fluorite structure of prepared nanoceria. Influence of pH on surface morphology of ceria nanoparticles was evi- dent from SEM images with significant changes in each case. Irregular, small and agglomerated crystals were observed in acidic conditions. Neutral environment resulted in complex mixture of spherical and rod like assembly, while in alkaline state defined cubical morphology was obtained. Also, aver- age crystallite size tends to decrease from acidic to alkaline

conditions. On increasing, calcination temperature strongly affirms its significance on crystallite size. Small crystals at lower temperature attain improvement in crystallinity at higher temperature.
