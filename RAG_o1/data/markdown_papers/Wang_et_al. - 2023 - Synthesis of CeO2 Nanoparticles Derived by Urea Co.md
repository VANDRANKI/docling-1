# Abstract

The synthesis of  CeO2 nanoparticles for  CeO2 based slurry gains continuous emphasis on improving its performance in the chemical mechanical polishing of dielectric materials. Urea was selected to dominate the growth and morphology during the calcination process. Thermogravimetry experiments were used to analyze the the decomposition behavior. Particle mor- phology and size were analyzed. Crystalline phase information and surface valence were used to compare the differences in surface physical and chemical properties of ceria by different synthesis process. The  CeO2 nanoparticles synthesized with urea were dispersed in water as slurry. The particle sizes of  CeO2 were measured by dynamic light scattering. The Zeta potential of  CeO2 dispersion were measured to show dispersing performance. The  CeO2 nanoparticles synthesized with urea condensation show good monodisperse properties. The material removal rate of silicon oxide and surface quality after chemical mechanical polishing were selected to evaluate the chemical mechanical polishing performance. The  CeO2 nanopar- ticles synthesized with urea condensation not only yielded better surface quality results than the commercial slurry but also showed a 153% (pH = 4) and 100% (pH = 10) increase in the material removal rate of silicon oxide compared to commercial.

1  Introduction 


With  the  decreasing  of  critical  dimension,  Chemical Mechanical Polishing (CMP) has played an increasingly important role in integrated circuit fabrication. It is widely 


believed that slurry is one of the important CMP consum- able materials [1]. In the logic chip manufacturing process, there are many dielectric CMP processes [2], such as Shal- low Trench Isolation (STI), Inter-level Dielectric (ILD) and Ploy Silicon Open (POP) process, which need  CeO2 based

slurry [3]. The synthesis [4] of  CeO2 nanoparticles in  CeO2 based slurry gains continuous emphasis on improving its performance in the CMP of dielectric materials. 


The physical properties of  CeO2 nanoparticles in  CeO2 based slurry are significantly affected by the category and circumstance of synthesis [5]. The CMP performances of CeO2 nanoparticles synthesized by different categories [6] and circumstances have been extensively investigated [7]. Calcination is a straightforward access to acquire  CeO2 nanoparticles [8]. Calcined  CeO2 has high  SiO2 Material Removal Rate (MRR) [9] and good within-wafer uniform- ity [7]. Previous studies [10] have shown that the higher the calcination temperature, the higher the CMP MRR of ceria [11]. Ceria calcined at 900 ℃ has the highest MRR 
[12]. However, calcined  CeO2 is prone to sintering and
agglomeration at high calcination temperatures [13]. In general, calcined  CeO2 usually requires subsequent milling processes [14] to achieve the desired size [15], which con- sumes considerable energy [16]. Therefore, a new method that can prevent agglomeration during the calcination of ceria particle must be proposed. 


In this work, urea was selected to dominate the growth of particle during the calcination process. Therefore, the find- ings in the manuscript provide the correlation between the growth state of  CeO2 nanoparticles and the calcination pro- cess controlled by urea [17]. In addition, the dispersion and CMP performance of the  CeO2 nanoparticles were measured. 


2   Experimental Procedure 


## 2.1   Synthesis of Materials

Calcination  thermal  decomposition  was  a  common  and widespread process to synthesize  CeO2. In this research, Ce2(CO3)3·6H2O was used as the source of ceria. 


Urea and  Ce2(CO3)3·6H2O were mixed as a 1:1 molar ratio to get a uniform paste. The other was prepared without urea. The paste was exsiccated to solid under a constant tem- perature oil bath condition at 70 ℃. The solid was calcined in muffle furnace at 900 ℃ with a heating rate at 10 °C/ min, maintained at a constant temperature for 10 h and then naturally cooled down to room temperature. The process of the synthesis of  CeO2 nanoparticles with urea is shown in Fig. 1. The decomposition behavior of two kinds of exsic- cated solid was monitored by thermal gravimetric apparatus (TGA/DSC1, Mettler Toledo) up to 900 ℃ at a heating rate of 10 °C/min in air. 


## 2.2   Materials Characterization

The size and morphology of  CeO2 were observed by scan- ning electron microscopy (SEM, SU8200, Hitachi). The 


Fig. 1   Flow chart of the synthesis of  CeO2 nanoparticles with urea 


lattice structure and grain size were analyzed by the X-ray diffraction (XRD, D/max-2550, Rigaku) using a Cu-Kα X-ray source (40 kV, 40 mA) in the range of 20–90°. 


The  valence  states  of  cerium  were  carried  out  using X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS, PHI Quantera II, Ulvac-Phi). The fraction of  Ce3+ was calculated based on the deconvolution [18] of Ce 3d spin-orbit doublet using Casa XPS. 


## 2.3   CMP Process

CeO2 nanoparticles calcined with urea were dispersed in deionized water, the mass content of the dispersion was 0.3%, and the pH of the dispersion was adjusted by nitric acid and ammonia [19]. The  CeO2 dispersions were prepared by continuous ultrasonication and stirring for 10 h. 


The  particle  size  of  dispersed   CeO2  nanoparticles was measured by a laser particle size analyzer (380ZLS, PSS). The Zeta potential of dispersed  CeO2 nanoparticles was measured by a zeta potential analyzer (90Plus PALS, Brookhaven). 


50  mm  Plasma-Enhanced  Tetraethyl  Orthosilicate (PETEOS) silicon oxide wafers were prepared by SKW Associates, Inc. for CMP process. The thicknesses of the as-deposited oxide were 10 kA. Wafers were polished on a CMP machine (Universal-150Plus, Hwatsing) with a CMP pad (DH3010, Dinglong). Ex-situ conditioning was car- ried out with a diamond dresser (A165, 3 M) before each polishing. The head/platen rotational speed was 87/93 rpm, the slurry flow rate was 150 ml/min, and the down pressure was 3 psi. The main polishing time is 60 s. The commercial slurry for comparison is Ces333F from AGC. 


The MRR of CMP process was calculated by the thick- ness difference of wafers [20] before and after CMP process that were measured by by Filmetrics (F50, Filmetric). The surface quality after CMP process was observed by atomic force microscope (AFM, Icon, Bruker). The average rough- ness (Ra) was determined within 2.0 × 2.0 µm2.

3   Results and Discussion 


## 3.1   Surface Morphology of  CeO2 Nanoparticles

The SEM images of the  CeO2 nanoparticles are shown in Fig. 2, which provide the information of particle mor- phology. The shape of the  CeO2 nanoparticles synthesized with urea is near-spherical and shows good monodisperse properties. 


It is clear that the particle sizes of the two kinds of CeO2 are around 60 nm.  CeO2 nanoparticles synthesized without urea are obviously agglomerated to form a strip particle combination.  CeO2 usually has a strong precur- sor inheritance during the calcination process, so the strip particle combination is likely to be the morphology of cerium carbonate [21]. 


However, when urea is involved in the calcination pro- cess, the growth and combination of  CeO2 nanoparticles are significantly changed. This phenomenon can be attrib- uted to the thermal condensation reaction of urea [22]. The condensation reaction of urea occurs in the two-way reaction of dissolution and precipitation of cerium carbon- ate. The condensation product has a template effect so that CeO2 nanoparticles can grow in a monodisperse form [23]. The  results  of  thermogravimetry  experiments  are shown in Fig. 3, which could reflect the changes of phase in the calcination process. In the TG curve of the calci- nation process without urea, the low weight loss within lower temperature range (≤ 100 °C) indicates that there

Fig. 3   Thermogravimetry (TG) curves of  CeO2 nanoparticles synthe- sized with urea and without urea 


is  no  loss  of  crystal  water  in  the  process.  This  result shows that the exsiccation process at 70 °C was suffi- cient. The rapid weight loss from 240 to 290 °C indicates that cerium carbonate was rapidly decomposed. The TG curve of the calcination process with urea is more com- plex. The slow weight loss begins at 80 °C, which could be explained that urea began to react. Subsequently, the decline rate of the curve changed at 240 °C. Cerium car- bonate began to decompose. Contrary to the previous rapid decline, the decomposition of cerium carbonate gradually completed with the increase of temperature. This  result  shows  that  the  decomposition  of  cerium

the typical pattern of fluorite structure and correspond well with the standard data of JCPDS No. 34-0394 [25]. Accord- ing to the Debye-Scherrer equation, the crystallite size could be calculated based on the broadening of the diffraction peak and the Bragg angle [26]. 


There are almost no differences in the concentration of Ce3+ and crystallite size between the two kinds of  CeO2 nanoparticles. Because of the presence of urea, the crystal- linity of the product decreased slightly. However, urea con- densation could not change the surface and structural prop- erties of  CeO2 nanoparticles. This result further confirms that the urea condensation reaction only acts as a physical template. The  CeO2 nanoparticles synthesized with urea have the similar physical and chemical properties to general calcined ceria. 


## 3.3   CMP Performance

Figure 7 compares the particle size of the two kinds of  CeO2 nanoparticles with different pH measured by dynamic light scattering [27]. Figure 7a shows that the mean diameter of CeO2 nanoparticles synthesized without urea is approxi- mately 600 nm with a wide distribution range. 


Figure 7b–d show that the  CeO2 nanoparticles synthe- sized with urea have good dispersion. Simultaneously, the particle size had good stability and did not fluctuate greatly with the change of pH value [28]. Table 2 shows the standard deviation of DLS particle sizes. Compared with the initial particle size without regulating pH, the mean diameter was smaller and the particle size distri- bution  was  more  concentrated  at  pH = 4  and  pH = 10. Table 2 also shows the Zeta potential of  CeO2 dispersion prepared by nanoparticles synthesized with urea at differ- ent pH value. This result is consistent with the results of

## 3.2   Surface and Structural Properties

XPS spectra in Figs. 4 and 5 show the difference of the con- centration of  Ce3+ between two kinds of  CeO2 nanoparticles. Table 1 shows the concentration of  Ce3+ in the  CeO2 nanopar- ticles conducted by peak deconvolution of XPS spectra [24]. Figure 6 shows the crystalline phase information of the CeO2 nanoparticles synthesized without urea and with urea by XRD. The XRD patterns of  CeO2 nanoparticles remain

previous studies on  CeO2 dispersions. Meanwhile, when the pH is not regulated, that is, the pH is close to the iso- electric point of ceria, the absolute value of Zeta potential of  CeO2 dispersion is lower and the dispersion is slightly worse, which also corresponds to the increase of mean particle size. This phenomenon indicates that the  CeO2 nanoparticles synthesized with urea could be used as a

The MRR of PETEOS of CMP experiments are shown in Fig. 8. The initial ceria without regulating pH showed a higher MRR because of the bigger mean diameter. The MRR of PETEOS was higher in acidic slurry (at pH 4) than that in alkaline slurry (at pH 10), mainly due to the different elec- trostatic interactions between abrasive and the wafer surface

4   Conclusions 


Urea was selected to dominate the growth and morphology during the calcination process. The urea condensation prod- ucts made the calcined  CeO2 exhibit good monodisperse characteristics by affecting the decomposition of cerium carbonate and the growth of  CeO2. At the same time, the urea condensation reaction did not affect the crystal struc- ture and surface properties of the calcined  CeO2. The  CeO2 nanoparticles synthesized with urea condensation had good dispersion in water at a wide pH value and satisfactory CMP performance. The  CeO2 nanoparticles synthesized with urea condensation not only yielded better surface quality results than the commercial slurry but also showed a 153% (pH = 4) and 100% (pH = 10) increase in the material removal rate of silicon oxide compared to commercial. The result of this research greatly reduces the energy consumption and time in the synthesis of calcined  CeO2 slurry. This research pro- vides a broad prospect for the subsequent development of CMP slurry.
