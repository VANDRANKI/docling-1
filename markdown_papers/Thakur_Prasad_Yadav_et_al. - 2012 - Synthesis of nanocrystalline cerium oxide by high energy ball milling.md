# Abstract

We  have  synthesized  pure  nanocrystalline  CeO2 powders  of  nearly  spherical  shape  using  high-energy  attritor  ball  mill.  Milling  parameters  such as  the  milling  speed  of  400  rpm,  ball  to  powder  ratio  (40:1),  milling  time  (30  h)  and  water  cooled  media  were  determined  to  be  suitable  for synthesizing  nanosize  ((cid:2)10  nm)  powders  of  CeO2.  The  powders  after  milling  for  various  durations  (up-to  50  h)  were  characterized  by  X-ray Diffraction,  Scanning  Electron  Microscopy,  Energy-dispersive  X-ray  Spectrometry  and  Transmission  Electron  Microscopy.  An  average  particle size  of  10  nm  was  obtained  at  30  h  milling,  after  which  the  particle  agglomeration  started,  and  a  mixture  of  nanocrystalline  and  amorphous  phase was  observed  after  50  h  milling. #

## 1.  Introduction

Oxides  of  rare  earth  elements  are  used  widely  in  the  catalyst industry  to  improve  activity,  selectivity  and  thermal  stability. Cerium  dioxide  (ceria,  CeO2)  has  been  widely  investigated  in recent  years  since  it  is  a  promising  material  for  number  of applications  and therefore,  holds  particular  signiﬁcance amongst  the  rare  earth  oxides  [1,2].  For  example,  CeO2 is becoming  an  important  material  constituent  in  various  ﬁelds  of modern technology,  such  as  catalysis,  microelectronics, optoelectronics,  electrochemical  devices  and  ultraviolet blockers  [3–5].  Also,  the  ability  of  cerium  oxide  to  interact with  phosphate  ester  bonds  of  biologically  relevant  molecules has their  use  as  potential therapeutics 
[6].  The  microstructure  dependent  physical
properties  have  been  studied  in  thin  ﬁlms  of  CeO2 [7,8]. The  shape  dependent  sensing  properties  of  CeO2 have  been reported  and  this  provides  a  new  application  of  CeO2 dendrites 
[9].  The  ultraﬁne  nm-sized  particles  of  CeO2 have  attracted
much  attention  since  these  particles  often  exhibit  physical  and chemical  properties  that  are  signiﬁcantly  different  from  those of  bulk  materials  [10].  These  CeO2 ultraﬁne  ((cid:2)3  nm)  particles

have  been  prepared  by room temperature  [10].  The  grain-size-dependent  electrical  con- ductivity  of  cerium  oxide  has  been  analyzed  experimentally  as well  as  theoretically  using  the  space  charge  model  for  ionic solids spray pyrolysis,  microwave  assisted  thermal  decomposition,  electro synthesis,  gas  condensation,  hydrothermal  technique,  homo- geneous  precipitation  and  ﬂux  methods  have  been  investigated to  synthesize  nano-sized  cerium  dioxide  powders  [12–18].  The synthesis  of  ultraﬁne  cerium  dioxide  (CeO2)  powders  by anhydrous  CeCl3 and  NaOH  powders,  along  with  NaCl  diluent via  mechanochemical  reaction  and  subsequent  calcination  has been  reported  [19].  Recently,  nanocrystalline  CeO2 samples were  synthesized  by  a  nonaqueous  sol–gel  method  and  their surface  and  interfacial  areas  were  determined  from  nitrogen adsorption  [20].  Considerable  effort  has  been  invested  in  order to  produce  nano-materials  by  mechanical  milling/alloying 
[21].  This  process  has  emerged  as  a  popular  method  because  of
the  possibility  of  producing  large  quantities  of  powders  by repeated  welding, re-welding  of  powder particles  subjected  to  high  energy  [22,23].  It  is  difﬁcult  to synthesize  nano-size  CeO2 powders  by  mechanical  milling because  of  the  tendency  of  nanoparticles  to  form  agglomerates during  milling  [24].  Nevertheless,  some  efforts  have  been made  to  synthesize  nano-sized  CeO2 powder  by  mechanical milling  [25,26].  Also,  nano-composite  powders  of  CeO2/Zn

have  been  prepared  with  high-energy  ball  milling  where corrosion resistance,  hardness  and  uniformity  of  metal structure  were signiﬁcantly  by  encorporating nano-CeO2 [27].  High-energy  ball  milling  was  found  as  a new  process  for  the  synthesis  of  pure  gadolinium-doped  ceria solid  solution  with  homogenous  microstructure  and  very  ﬁne particles  containing  nanocrystallites  in  the  range  of  (cid:2)50  nm 
[28].



In  the  present  work  nanocrystalline  cerium  oxide  powder  has been  synthesized  by  high  energy  ball  milling.  Nano-sized  ceria particles  have  been  produced  after  30  h  milling  of  as-received cerium  powders  of  the  micron  size  using  ball  milling  technique. 


## 2.  Experimental  procedures

The  cerium  (Ce)  powders  from  Alfa  Aesar  with  99.6% purity  and  average  particle  size  of  (cid:2)5  mm,  were  used  as  starting material.  A  high-energy  attritor  ball  mill  (Szegvori  attritor)  was employed  for  mechanical  ball  milling  (BM)  with  a  ball  to powder  ratio  of  40:1.  The  attritor  has  a  cylindrical  stainless  steel tank  of  an  inner  diameter  of  13  cm.  The  angular  speed  of  the milling  was  maintained  at  400  rpm  and  the  milling  operation was  conducted  from  10  to  50  h  in  dry  (air  atmosphere)  medium. All  the  milling  experiments  were  performed  under  chilled water-cooling  system.  The  milled  powder  was  characterized  by X-ray  diffraction  (XRD)  with  CuKa (l  =  1.5402  A˚ )  radiation using  Philips  1710  X-ray  diffractometer.  Structural  and microstructural  characterizations  of  mechanically  milled powders  were  performed  using  a  FEI:  Technai  20  G2 transmission  electron  microscope (TEM)  at  200  kV.  The elemental  analysis  was  done  using  energy  dispersive  X-ray (EDX)  attached  to  a  QUANTA  scanning  electron  microscope (SEM)  operating  at  20  kV.

The  typical  XRD  patterns  of  CeO2 as  a  function  of  milling time  are  shown  in  Fig.  1(a–e).  All  the  peaks  have  been  indexed with  cubic  structure  (ﬂuorite  type)  of  CeO2 with  a  lattice parameter  of,  a  =  5.42  A˚ .  The  ﬂuorite  structure  of  cerium  oxide was  not  affected  by  ball  milling.  However,  the  degree  of crystallinity  decreased  at  higher  milling  times  (after  30  h).  The XRD  peaks (Fig.  1(b–e))  became  broader  after  milling, indicating  that  formation  of  nano-sized  CeO2 occurs  as  a result  of  milling  after  20  h.  The  intensities  of  XRD  peaks  were observed  to  decrease  with  milling  time.  However,  no  additional peaks  corresponding  to  any  new  phase  were  observed  up  to  50  h of  milling  indicating  high  purity  of  the  ﬁnal  products.  After 50  h  of  milling,  peak  broadening  appeared  in  the  XRD  pattern at  around  34-,  which  suggests  amorphous  phase  formation together  with  nano  CeO2.  The  XRD  pattern  of  20–40  h  of milling (1  1  1) diffraction  peak  of  CeO2 phase  is  considerably  broadened after  ball  milling,  suggesting that  nano-crystalline  phase appears  as  a  result  of  milling.  The  crystalline  sizes  of  milled powders  are time.  The crystalline  size  and  the  lattice  strain  of  the  sample  can  be

where  a0,  a1 and  a2 are  Cauchy  constants,  b0,  b1/2,  b1 and  b2 are Gaussian  constants  and  c  =  2v/b  where  b  is  the  integral breadth  obtained  from  XRD  peak.  The  values  of  Cauchy  and Gaussian  constant  have  been  taken  from  the  table  of  de  Keijser et  al.  [30]:  a0 =  2.0207,  a1 =  0.4803,  a2 =  1.7756;  b0 =  0.6420, b1/2 =  1.4187,  b1 =  2.2043,  b2 =  1.8706.  From  these,  we  have calculated  the  crystallite  size  D  and  the  lattice  strain  ‘e’  for  the milled  powder. 


The  overall  variation  of  crystallite  size,  lattice  strain  and lattice  parameter  with  milling  time  of  CeO2 nano  particle  are shown  in  Table  1.  The  lattice  strain  of  CeO2 initially  increases up  to  0.80%  after  30  h  of  milling  and  thereafter  decreases  to 0.52%  after  50  h.  From  this  table  it  is  clear  that  the  crystallite size  of  CeO2 decreases  at  a  faster  rate  during  initial  milling times  and  then  goes  down  at  a  relatively  slower  rate  to  ﬁnally attain  a  size  of  (cid:2)8  nm  during  milling  operation.  It  is  interesting to  note  that  the  lattice  parameter  is  also  found  to  increase  during

30  h  ball  milled  CeO2 powder  with  agglomerated  morphology and  this  type  of  microstructure  was  found  to  be  uniform throughout.  A  uniform  small  grain  distribution  can  be  seen  in the  dense  microstructure.  Energy  dispersive  X-ray  (EDX) analysis  with  color  mapping  of  30  h  BM  CeO2 has  been  shown in  Fig.  3  which  reveals  that  the  contents  are  limited  to  Ce  and oxygen  only.  It  may  be  noticed  that  no  other  contamination  like Fe,  Cr  or  N  has  been  detected.  This  could  probably  be  due  to  the ice  cooled  ball  milling  experiment.  The  color  mapping  of  EDX analysis  shows  homogeneous  distributions  of  Ce  and  oxygen. The  nano-phase  formation  and  milling  effect  was  also conﬁrmed  by transmission  electron  microscopy.  Fig.  4(a) shows  a  bright-ﬁeld  (BF)  electron  micrograph  of  10  h  BM CeO2 powders.  The  grain  sizes  are  found  to  vary  from  (cid:2)150  to 200  nm.  Fig.  4(b)  shows  a  corresponding  selected  area  electron diffraction  (SAD)  pattern  which  can  be  indexed  based  on  face centered  cubic  (FCC)  phase  (a  =  5.4  A˚ )  along  [0  0  1]  zone  axis. These  features  suggest  the  formation  of  disordered  CeO2 phase, which  is  in  agreement  with  the  XRD  results.  A  typical  TEM micrograph  of  the  30  h  milled  sample  is  shown  in  Fig.  4(c); from  this,  the  average  particle  size  of  as-milled  sample  has  been estimated  to  be  (cid:2)11  nm.  The  gray  and  white  areas  have  been identiﬁed  as  different  orientations  in  the  nano-CeO2 crystal- lites.  The  corresponding  selected  area  electron  diffraction pattern  is  shown  in  Fig.  4(d),  which  conﬁrms  the  presence  CeO2 with  a  sharp  spotty  ring.  The  TEM  micrograph  of  further  milled (50  h)  powder  is  shown  in  Fig.  4(e)  and  the  corresponding  SAD patterns  in  Fig.  4(f)  are  identiﬁed  to  be  of  the  CeO2 cubic  phase. The  crystallite/grain  size  distribution  has  been  determined  from 30  h  BM  CeO2 BF  TEM  micrographs,  showing  an  average grain  size  of  (cid:2)11  nm  as  shown  in  Fig.  5.  The  distribution  of grain/crystallite  sizes  determined  by  TEM  was  normalized  to unit  area  and  standard  deviation  of  the  size  distributions  is calculated  to  be  (cid:2)3  nm.  The  histograms  of  crystallite  size distribution  shows  a  very  narrow  dispersion  in  the  size  of  CeO2 obtained  in  the  present  experimental  conditions.

Typically,  grains  are  rounded  with  sizes between  8  and  12  nm,  and  no  signiﬁcant  through-thickness variations  are  observed.  Careful  inspection  reveals  that  some crystals  are  oriented  along  the  [0  0  1]  direction  indicated  by  an arrow.  Simple  inspection  of  their  lattice  images  reveals  that  the grains  are  highly  disorientated  from  each  other.  The  lattice parameter  is  calculated  by  the  crystallographic  planes  and  it  is close  to  the  lattice  parameter  calculated  by  XRD.  The  HREM

observation  in  this  study  indicates  that  CeO2 prepared  by  high energy  BM  method  consists  of  small  crystallites  with  different crystallographic  orientations  separated  by  grain  boundaries. The  average  grain  size  obtained  from  measuring  more  than  10 grains  was  about  10  nm.  The  HRTEM  image  of  a  typical  area, which  contains  a  number  of  grains  and  grain  boundaries,  is shown  in  Fig.  6.  It  can  be  seen  that  most  of  the  grain  boundaries of  CeO2 have  ordered  structures;  however,  the  grain  boundary facets  are  curved  and  coarse  due  to  the  strain  induced  during BM.  Lattice  fringes  near  the  grain  boundary  are  somewhat distorted,  which  indicates  the  presence  of  local  strain  in  the grain  boundary  regions.  However,  HRTEM  of  longer  BM (50  h)  powder  shows  more  disordered  grain  boundary  regions in  Fig.  6(b).  In  other  words,  CeO2 consists  of  a  crystalline matrix  surrounded  by  amorphous is  also supported  by  the  Fourier  transform  (inset  of  Fig.  6(b))  taken from  region  ‘A’.  From is apparent  that  the  amorphous  phases  in  CeO2 nanomaterials depend  on  the  milling  time.  It  can  be  concluded  that,  the  30  h BM  can  be  considered  as  best  milling  time  parameter  for  the synthesis  of  CeO2 nano  crystallites  using  the  present  synthesis method.

The  experimental  studies  on  the  synthesis  of  nano-sized CeO2 using  high-energy  ball  milling  technique  have  been reported  [25–28].  The  thermodynamic  driving  force  is  quite favorable  for  CeO2 formation  at  room  temperature  during  BM. However,  previous  studies  have taken  several  elements/ compounds  as  a  precursor  for  the  synthesis  and  the  CeO2 powders  were  not  homogenous  in  size.  In  our  present  study,  it was  found  that  the  mechanical  milling  of  Ce  in  oxygen  ambient results  in  the  formation  of  CeO2 in  the  initial  stages  of  milling, 


time,  as  shown 


i.e.  at  10  h,  and  ﬁnally  a  nano-crystalline  ((cid:2)10  nm)  micro- structure  of  CeO2 is  obtained  after  30  h  of  BM.  However,  in further  milling  (40  h  and  50  h)  amorphous  layers  around  the CeO2 crystallites  have  been  observed.  Therefore,  it  is  clear from  above  observation  that  the  longer  milling  times  are  not favorable  for  the  synthesis  of  homogenous  nano-crystalline CeO2.  It  seems  that  the  grain  reﬁnement  during  the  initial  stages of  milling  (up  to  10  h  BM)  is  accompanied  by  oxidation  of  Ce while  further  milling  results  in  grain  reduction  only.  This  can  be inferred  from  the  XRD  proﬁle,  where  the  broadening  as  well  as weakening  of  the  XRD  peaks  is  observed  with  the  increasing milling in  Fig.  1.  These  results  may  be associated  with  enhanced  dislocation  density  and  CeO2 formation  in  addition  to  grain  size  reduction.  From  the  X- ray  diffraction  patterns,  it  is  evident  that  the  formation  of disordered  CeO2 can  be  achieved  by  high  energy  BM  alone.  At the  initial  stage  of  milling,  i.e.  20  h  BM,  the  disordered  CeO2 phase  contains  large  amount  of  defects  and  grain  boundaries resulting  in  considerable  strain.  Therefore  additional  milling treatment to  attain  a to  allow mechanical  and  statistical  equilibrium.  Here  further  milling is  sufﬁcient  to  reduce  the  defects  leading  to  strain-relaxation. However,  small  amounts  of  strain  have  been  observed  in  even longer  milling  periods  as  can  be  seen  in  Table  1.  It  should  be pointed  out  that  all  the  strain  cannot  be  fully  removed  by mechanical  milling  and  post  annealing  alone  as  other equilibration  processes  are  critical  steps  to  obtain  strain-free nano-phases  [31].  Another  effect  related  to  the  reduced  size  of the  crystallites  as  well  as  oxide  phase  formation  under  our present  experimental  conditions  might  be  due  to  cooling.  The whole  milling  chamber  is  a  chilled  water-cooled  system.  Due  to

the  Gibbs–Thomson  effect, the  solubilities  of  solutes  are expected  to  be  enhanced  in  solid  solution,  with  grain  reﬁnement down  to  the  nanometer  regime  [29].  In  the  nanocrystalline  state, solute  atoms  are  known  to  segregate  to  the  boundaries  forming a  solute  cloud  in  the  vicinity  of  the  boundaries.  Therefore,  the solid  solubility  in  the  grain  boundaries  may  differ  considerably from  that  in  the  interior  of  the  crystal.  During  further  milling  in presence  of  metastable  CeO2 phase  solid  solution,  nucleation 


processes  leading  to  stable  single-phase  formation  of  CeO2 may take  place  under  appropriate  thermodynamic  conditions.  We would  also  like  to  point  out  that  due  to  the  formation  of  nano sized  Ce  during  the  very  initial  stages  of  milling;  there  is  a possibility  of  signiﬁcant  surface  diffusion,  which  would enhance  the  oxidation  of  Ce.  However,  it  must  be  emphasized that  there  is  a  need  for  further  study  to  conﬁrm  the  sequence  of the  CeO2 formation  during  high-energy  ball  milling.

The  optimum  milling  time  was  determined  to  be 30  h  under  ice  cooled  milling  atmosphere.  The  CeO2 are uniformly  distributed  and  randomly  oriented  with  ultraﬁne crystallites.
