The synthesis of ultrafine cerium dioxide (CeO2) powders via mechanochemical reaction and subsequent calcination was studied. Anhydrous CeCl3 and NaOH powders, along with NaCl diluent, were mechanically milled. A solid-state displace- 1 3NaCl—was ment reaction—CeCl3 induced during milling in a steady-state manner. Calcination of the as-milled powder in air at 500°C resulted in the formation of CeO2 nanoparticles in the NaCl matrix. A simple washing process to remove the NaCl yielded CeO2 particles ;10 nm in size. The particle size was controlled in the range of ;10 –500 nm by changing the calcination temperature.

al.22 used a homogeneous precipitation method to directly precip- itate CeO2 particles ;70 nm in size. Masui and co-workers23,24 used a microemulsion method to obtain separated CeO2 nanopar- ticles ;4 nm in size. However, application of the method to industrial production is limited, because of the low yield rate. An inductively coupled plasma spray (spray-ICP) technique has been applied to synthesize materials with high melting points; Suzuki et al.25 produced geometrically shaped CeO2 that was ,50 nm in size, but only at a low yield rate. A method to synthesize nanophase CeO2 with high surface area and small particle size is still under intense investigation.

# Introduction

RECENTLY, cerium oxide (CeO2) has attracted much attention, 


because of its many practical uses, such as chemical mechan- ical polishing media,1 automobile exhaust catalysts,2 additives in ceramics such as zirconium-toughened alumina to enhance sinter- ing properties,3 and solid electrolytes in solid oxide fuel cells.4 Ultrafine powder is particularly important for many of these applications, because of its small size, high surface area, and improved sintering properties. 


The usual method for the production of fine CeO2 powders is a thermal decomposition of cerium salt precursors such as hydrox- ide, carbonate, and oxide hydrate that have been derived from sol– gel routes or wet chemical precipitation.5,6 Although very porous powders with high surface areas are produced using this method, the minimum particle size obtained is limited to micro- meter sizes, because of aggregation during thermal decomposi- tion.7–9 Several decomposition methods to avoid the agglomera- tion have been studied. Levin et al.10 used a vibrational–thermal method, i.e., dynamic thermal decomposition of cerium carbonate. Mani et al.11 used a sol-spray technique. However, the mean particle sizes were still .100 nm. 


Various other methods of synthesizing ultrafine CeO2 powder have been investigated.12 Flash-combustion synthesis that in- volves the rapid decomposition of a saturated aqueous solution containing ceric ammonium nitrate and urea is suitable for large- quantity production. However, this method yields large particle sizes (;1 mm), which makes the application of nanoparticle synthesis difficult.13,14 Hydrothermal synthesis, which involves precipitation from aqueous solutions under elevated temperature and pressure, has been used to produce CeO2 nanoparticles 10 – 20 nm in size. However, this method requires heat treatment for several hours under high pressure (10 –100 MPa).15–19 A wet chemical precipitation method has been successfully used to synthesize semiconductor quantum dots20,21 and has been applied to the production of CeO2 nanoparticles. For example, Chen et

Recently, mechanochemical processing has been applied for the synthesis of a wide range of nanoparticulate materials.26,27 Ding and co-workers28 –34 reported the synthesis of nanoparticles of several transition metals and ceramics, such as Al2O3, ZrO2, Fe2O3, and ZnS; this group of researchers used a novel method that involved mechanical activation of the solid-state displacement reactions to synthesize these nanoparticles. Milling of the precur- sor powders leads to the formation of a nanoscale composite structure of the starting materials that react during milling or subsequent heat treatment to form a mixture of separated nano- crystals of the desired phase within a soluble salt matrix. For example, ultrafine ZrO2 powder was synthesized via the milling and subsequent heat treatment of a mixture of ZrCl4 and CaO 1 powder. The displacement reaction, ZrCl4 2CaCl2, was induced in a steady-state manner, forming ZrO2 nanoparticles within a CaCl2 matrix. Removal of the CaCl2 by-product with a simple washing process resulted in separated ZrO2 particles ;5 nm in size.32

An investigation of the synthesis of rare-earth-oxide nanopar- ticles via mechanochemical processing was conducted for Gd2O3 1 3CaCl2.35 However, 1 3CaO 3 Gd2O3 via the reaction 2GdCl3 only large particles (100 nm in size) were obtained, because of the complicated reaction route: GdOCl was formed during milling, 1 and the reaction 6GdOCl 1 2Ca4OCl6 9CaCl2 occurred only during heat treatment at high temperature. Therefore, the above-described reaction was not suitable for the synthesis of nanosized Gd2O3 particles. Furthermore, reactions between a rare-earth chloride and an alkali-earth oxide cannot be applied to synthesize light-rare-earth oxides such as La2O3, CeO2, Pr2O3, Nd2O3, and Sm2O3, because of the high stability of rare-earth oxychlorides. The change in free energy in the reaction 2ROCl 1 CaO 3 R2O3 1 CaCl2 (where R is a rare-earth element) is positive for lightweight lanthanides such as lanthanum, neody- mium, and samarium; however, the change in free energy is negative for gadolinium and the heavier lanthanides. 


As an alternative route for the synthesis of rare-earth-oxide 1 3NaOH 3 nanoparticles, the mechanochemical reaction GdCl3 1 3NaCl and a subsequent calcination was studied.36 Gd(OH)3 1 3NaOH 3 The solid-state displacement 1 3NaCl was induced during milling, and calcination of Gd(OH)3 the as-milled powder at 500°C led to the formation of Gd2O3 particles. The addition of a sufficient amount of NaCl diluent in the starting powder resulted in the formation of ultrafine Gd2O3 particles ;20 nm in size.

II. Experimental Procedure 


The starting materials were anhydrous CeCl3 powder (99.9% pure, 220 mesh; Cerac, Milwaukee, WI), NaOH (99.99% pure, in pellet form; Aldrich, Milwaukee, WI), and NaCl (99.8% pure, in the form of beads; Sigma, St. Louis, MO). The CeCl3 and NaCl powders were dried under vacuum at 200°C before use. The mixture of starting powders was sealed in a hardened-steel vial with hardened-steel balls 6.4 mm in diameter, under a high-purity argon-gas atmosphere. Milling was performed with a mixer/mill (Model 8000, Spex, Edison, NJ), using a ball-to-powder mass ratio of 10:1. To detect possible combustion events,37,38 the surface temperature of the vial was measured during milling, using a thermocouple that was attached to the outside surface of the vial. Calcination and annealing of the as-milled powder were conducted in an alumina crucible in air for 0.5 h. Removal of the NaCl by-product was performed by washing the powder with deionized water, using an ultrasonic bath and a centrifuge. The washed powder was dried in an oven (at 60°C) for several hours. 


The structure of the powder was examined under an argon-gas atmosphere at room temperature via X-ray diffractometry (XRD) (Model D5000, Siemens, Karlsruhe, Germany), using CuKa radi- ation. The mean crystallite size of the powder was estimated from the diffraction-peak width, using the Scherrer equation.39 The microstructure of the powder was studied via transmission electron microscopy (TEM) (Model 430, Philips, Eindhoven, the Nether- lands and Model 2000 FXII, JEOL, Tokyo, Japan, the latter of which was equipped with a energy-dispersive spectroscopy (EDS) system (Link Systems, High Wycombe, Buckinghamshire, U.K.)). For the TEM studies, the washed powder was dispersed in methanol using an ultrasonic bath and a drop of solution was placed on a copper grid that had been coated with holey carbon film. Simultaneous differential thermal analysis (DTA) and ther- mogravimetric analysis (TGA) were conducted using a thermal analysis system (Model Thermoflex, Rigaku, Tokyo, Japan) under a constant air flow of 2 cm3/min with a heating rate of 20°C/min. The specific surface area was measured via a Brunauer–Emmett- Teller (BET) nitrogen-gas absorption method at a temperature of 77 K (Model Gemini 2360, Micromeritics, Norcross, GA). The particle size was also measured via a laser light scattering (LLS) method (Model Mastersizer Microplus, Malvern Instruments, Malvern, U.K.). For the LLS measurements, powders were dis- persed in deionized water with a (NaPO3)6 dispersant, using an ultrasonic probe for .15 min. A density of 7.135 g/cm3 and real and imaginary parts of the refractive index—2.3 and 0.1, respec- tively—were used for the LLS measurements. Inductively coupled plasma–atomic emission spectroscopy (ICP–AES) analysis was conducted at the Chemistry Centre at the University of Western Australia, to analyze the CeO2 nanopowder for traces of elemental iron, sodium, and chlorine. 


III. Results and Discussion 


(1) Mechanochemical Reaction of CeCl3 and NaOH 


An abrupt increase in the vial temperature was observed after a powder mixture of CeCl3 and 3 mol of NaOH was milled for ;40 s. This phenomenon indicates that a self-propagating exo- thermal reaction (combustion) occurred during milling; this reac- tion was due to the large negative enthalpy change (2345 kJ)40,41 of the reaction

The milling was terminated 2 min after the combustion event. The powder obtained was attached to the inside of the vial as a hard cake and was difficult to recover. The XRD pattern of the powder consisted of peaks that corresponded to Ce(OH)3 and NaCl, as shown in pattern “(a)” in Fig. 1. Therefore, because of the

combustion event, the reaction was completed within a short time. To determine the decomposition temperature of the synthesized Ce(OH)3, simultaneous TGA and DTA measurements of the as-milled powder were conducted. Figure 2 shows DTA and TGA curves for the as-milled powder. The TGA curve shows that the powder mass started to decrease as the temperature increased from room temperature and attained a constant value at a temperature of ;350°C. Although a weak hump was observed at ;170°C, there was no clear evidence of a two-step decomposition, as in the case of Gd(OH)3.34 The calculated weight loss for the reaction

during heat treatment is 5.2 wt%. The measured weight loss was ;5%, which is almost the same as the calculated value. The air atmosphere was the oxygen source in reaction (2). The gradient of the DTA curve showed a gradual change in the temperature range between 20°C and 350°C, possibly due to the gradual change in the specific heat of the powder during reaction (2). It is not clear whether the kink at 130°C in the DTA curve is due to an

endothermic peak at ;120°C or a broad exothermic peak from 140°C to 350°C. 


The as-milled powder was heat-treated at 500°C for 0.5 h in air. Pattern “(b)” in Fig. 1 shows an XRD pattern of the powder after heat treatment. Ce(OH)3 evidently was converted to CeO2 during heat treatment via reaction (2). After the heat-treated powder was washed to remove the NaCl by-product, only the CeO2 phase was obtained, as shown in XRD pattern “(c)” in Fig. 1.42 


Figure 3 shows a typical TEM image of the CeO2 powder that was obtained. The powder consisted of particles 100-1000 nm in size, which were aggregates of crystallites 10 –30 nm in size. The mean crystallite size, as estimated from XRD peak broadening, was 12.5 nm, which is in good agreement with the crystallite sizes observed via TEM. The large particle size is due to the high temperature induced by the combustion event,28,30,38 as well as being due to the low volume ratio of NaCl to Ce(OH)3 in the product phase (NaCl:Ce(OH)3 


5 2.2:1).34 


The BET specific surface area of the powder was 64.5 m2/g. The particles could not be separated as spherical crystallites with a smooth surface (Fig. 3); therefore, the mean particle size was not calculated from the BET surface area. The high BET surface area was due to the porous structure of the aggregates. 


(2) Effect of Diluent 


To investigate the effect of diluent on the mechanochemical reaction, a NaCl diluent was added in the starting powder mixture. A stoichiometric mixture of starting powders that corresponded to the reaction equation 


CeCl3 


1 3NaOH 1 12NaCl 3 Ce(OH)3 


1 15NaCl 


(3) 


was milled for different times. The addition of 12 mol of NaCl to the reactants increased the volume fraction of NaCl in the product phase mixture to 90%. 


No combustion was detected during the milling of a powder mixture of CeCl3, 3 mol of NaOH, and 12 mol NaCl. The NaCl diluent prevented combustion from occurring, because of the following reasons: (i) NaCl separated the reactants, which reduced the collision frequency between the reactant particles and led to a decrease in the reaction rate and the rate of heat generation; (ii) NaCl absorbed the collision energy during milling, which reduced the energy that was transferred to the reactants; and (iii) NaCl absorbed the heat that was generated by the reaction, which prevented the excess increase in temperature during milling. 


Figure 4 shows XRD patterns of the powder that was milled for various times. As the milling time increased, the peaks associated with CeCl3 were gradually weakened, whereas the intensity of the peaks associated with Ce(OH)3 increased. This observation indi- cates that a solid-state displacement reaction occurred during

1 3NaOH 1 12NaCl powder mixture 


milling in a steady-state manner. After milling for 2 h, the XRD pattern consisted of peaks that were associated with Ce(OH)3 and NaCl. The width of the peaks that corresponded to Ce(OH)3 became narrower as the milling time increased from 2 h to 4 h. The mean crystallite size of Ce(OH)3 in the powder milled for 4 h, which was estimated from the XRD pattern using a peak at ;40°, was 10 nm. 


Following the results of TG/DTA measurements in section III(1), the as-milled powder was calcined at 500°C and subse- quently washed to remove NaCl. XRD measurements confirmed that only the CeO2 phase was obtained after washing. The mean crystallite size, as estimated from the XRD peak widths, was 10.2 nm. 


TEM analysis of the calcined and subsequently washed powder has shown that the particles sizes were 5– 40 nm and that only weak agglomeration of the particles was observed (see related image in Fig. 6(a)). Dark-field imaging revealed that each particle was a single crystal. No traces of sodium, chlorine, or iron were detected using EDS. ICP–AES analysis detected the presence of iron (0.023 wt%), sodium (0.244 wt%), and chlorine (0.045 wt%) in the CeO2 nanopowder. 


The BET surface area of the calcined and washed powder was 83 m2/g, which corresponds to a spherical particle size of 10 nm. This finding is in good agreement with the results of XRD and TEM analyses. Because of the addition of the NaCl diluent, the Ce(OH)3 particles were well isolated from each other in the NaCl matrix, which led to the formation of CeO2 particles as small as ;10 nm.34,36 


(3) Particle Growth The as-milled CeCl3 


1 3NaOH 1 12NaCl powder mixture was calcined at temperatures of 500°–1000°C and subsequently washed to remove NaCl. Figure 5 shows the XRD crystallite size, BET particle size, and LLS particle size of the CeO2 powders, each plotted as a function of the calcining temperature. The XRD peaks of CeO2 that was calcined at 1000°C had almost the same widths as the instrumental peak broadening; thus, accurate estimation of the crystallite size was not possible. LLS measurements for the

same as the BET particle size. This result suggests that the particles could be separated from each other, because the NaCl solid matrix isolated the CeO2 particles from each other. Above 800°C, the XRD crystallite size and BET particle size increased more rapidly than they did at ,800°C. The BET particle size increased more rapidly than the XRD crystallite size, and, after calcining at 900°C, was more than twice the XRD crystallite size. The difference between these sizes will be discussed later. The higher rate of particle-size growth at temperatures above 800°C than that at temperatures below 800°C is due to the molten NaCl matrix: the melting point of NaCl is 801°C, and sedimentation of CeO2 particles was observed after heat treatment above this temperature. This sedimentation caused the particles to come into contact with each other, which led to rapid particle growth. 


Figures 6(a)–(d) show TEM images of powder that has been calcined at different temperatures. CeO2 particles that have been synthesized via calcination at 500°C consisted of equiaxed parti- cles 5– 40 nm in size (Fig. 6(a)). CeO2 particles that have been synthesized via calcination at 800°C were spherical and 10 – 130 nm in size (Fig. 6(b)). This result is in good agreement with the XRD crystallite size and BET particle size observed at these temperatures. Loose agglomerations were evident in the TEM images, which was consistent with the fact that the XRD crystallite size was almost the same as the BET particle size, which suggests that the particles could be separated from each other. The TEM micrograph in Fig. 6(b) showed a rather-wide particle-size distri- bution, which was possibly due to Ostwald ripening. However, the

CeO2 particles calcined at ,800°C were not conducted, because the instrument could measure only particle sizes of .50 nm. 


Different temperature dependences of size growth were evident below and above 800°C. Below 800°C, the XRD crystallite size and BET particle size increased rather monotonously as the temperature increased. The XRD crystallite size was almost the

extensive overlapping of the particles in the images made estima- tion of the actual size distribution from the TEM images difficult. Figure 6(c) shows CeO2 particles that have been obtained via calcination at 850°C. Different stages of particle growth are evident. First, the particles are in contact with each other, sharing facets as indicated by feature “A” in Fig. 6(c). Second, some particles seem to form necks between them and have sintered together (feature “B” in Fig. 6(c)). The different contrast in the two sintering particles suggests that the particles still retain different crystal orientations. Finally, the neck disappears and a single crystallite is formed (feature “C” in Fig. 6(c)). Therefore, above 800°C, some particles could not be separated from each other anymore, because of the first and second stage of the particle growth due to interparticle sintering, which reduces the BET surface area and leads to the BET particle size becoming larger than the XRD crystallite size. 


The LLS size distributions for the powders that have been calcined at 850°, 900°, and 1000°C are shown in Fig. 7. The LLS particle size of the powder calcined at 850°C was ;230 nm, which is much larger than the XRD crystallite size (45.7 nm) and the BET particle size (84.7 nm). The same tendency in the difference between XRD, BET, and LLS particle sizes was observed for the powders that were calcined at 900° and 1000°C. This observation is due to the nonspherically shaped aggregates of sintered particles such as those labeled A, B, and C in Fig. 6(c). The general tendency when using LLS size distributions of nonspherical particles is to oversize the coarse end of the distribution, because LLS uses the longer axis of an elongated particle to determine the mean particle diameter.43 Another reason for obtaining a larger LLS size is that the fundamental size distribution, as derived via LLS, is based on volume; in other words, if a sample consists of an equal number of two sizes of particles, e.g., 50 nm and 100 nm, the volume of the 100-nm particles is 8 times larger than that of the 50-nm particles. Hence, as a volume distribution, the larger particles represent most of the total volume, which yields a mean particle size (as a peak position of the size distribution) by volume that is larger than that obtained by population. 


The sintering process of nanosized single crystals is very important in powder processing. The kinetics of grain growth consist of two regimes, i.e., sintering and subsequent coarsen- ing.44 – 48 The first regime (sintering) is described as follows. For small particles, surface diffusion is the dominant mass-transport mechanism. Negative surface curvature provides a more-stable environment to the mass on the surface than positive surface curvature; thus, the gap between the contacting particles is filled by the mass. Hence, if the particles are crystals, a grain boundary forms at the expense of surface energy. The neck radius attains a maximum static size, because of the equilibrium between grain- boundary energy and surface energy. In the second regime (coarsening), when adjacent sintered particles have different sizes,

mass transport is induced from the smaller particle to the larger one, because of the difference in the surface curvature. This phenomenon leads to the absorption of the smaller particle by the larger one, with a grain boundary retained between them. 


This general model of two-particle sintering is phenomenolog- ical and mostly based on ex situ observation of large (micrometer- sized) particle sintering.44 –50 However, the sintering properties of nanoparticles may be different from those of micrometer-sized particles. Moreover, ex situ TEM study has shown only sintering properties that have been averaged over the heating time. Recently, many in situ TEM studies of nanoparticle sintering have been conducted.51–53 Averback and co-workers54 –56 performed a molecular-dynamics simulation of the free sintering of nanosized TiO2 particles, as well as an in situ TEM study of the sintering of copper and silver nanoparticles. Sintered nanoparticle pairs reori- ented themselves, with respect to each other, in the coarsening regime, forming a low-energy grain boundary. This particle reorientation during coarsening was also observed by Rankin et al.57 in ZrO2 nanoparticles ;30 nm in size that were loosely attached to a carbon film on a TEM grid. However, when the ZrO2 nanoparticles were fixed to the TEM grid, the coarsening occurred via the absorption of smaller particles by larger ones, while a grain boundary was maintained between them.52 


In the present study, CeO2 nanoparticles formed nonspherical, sintered single crystallites, as shown by feature C in Fig. 6(c). This finding suggests that the grain boundary between two sintered particles disappeared before the smaller particle was absorbed by the larger one; i.e., coarsening occurred via particle reorientation. The particles were suspended in molten NaCl; thus, particle rotation, to minimize the grain-boundary energy, was possible. 


IV. Summary 


A solid-state displacement reaction between CeCl3 and NaOH was induced by mechanochemical processing, forming Ce(OH)3 in a NaCl matrix. Ultrafine CeO2 powders were obtained after the as-milled powders were calcined. A simple washing process was used to remove the NaCl by-product/diluent. Without any addition of NaCl diluent, calcination of the mechanochemically synthesized Ce(OH)3 resulted in the formation of porous CeO2 particles 0.1–1 mm in size. Although the particle size is rather large, the porous structure gave a high BET surface area. Milling with NaCl diluent led to the formation of CeO2 nanoparticles ;10 nm in size, because the mechanochemically formed hydroxide precursors isolated in the NaCl matrix, which prevented the were well particles from sintering together during thermal decomposition. Therefore, to obtain particles ;10 nm in size, it is necessary to cause a reaction in a steady-state manner, as well as to increase the matrix:powder volume ratio. The mean particle size was controlled in the range of 10 –500 nm by varying the calcination temperature. Almost-spherical particles were obtained after calcination at tem- peratures of .800°C. The difference between particle sizes ob- tained using XRD, BET, and LLS methods has been demonstrated to be a good indicator of particle aggregation. This synthesis method has potential for the economical and efficient production of ultrafine rare-earth-oxide powders.
