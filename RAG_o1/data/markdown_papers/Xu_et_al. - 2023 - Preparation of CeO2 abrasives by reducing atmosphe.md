Ce3þ as the active site on the CeO2 abrasive surface is the key to enhancing the material removal rate (MRR). The CeO2 abrasives with high chemical activity were prepared by the molten salt method under a reducing atmosphere. The crystal structure and morphology of CeO2 abrasives were characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR), ultravioletevisible diffuse reﬂectance spectroscopy (UVeVis DRS), and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). The CeO2 abrasives were obtained under different atmo- spheres (Air, Ar, and Ar/H2). With the enhancement of the reducing atmosphere, the morphology of the abrasives transforms from spherical to octahedral, while more oxygen vacancies and Ce3þ are generated on the surface of CeO2 abrasives. The CMP experiments show that the MRRs of the CeO2-Air, CeO2-Ar, and CeO2-Ar/H2 abrasives on SiO2 substrates are 337.60, 578.74, and 691.28 nm/min, respectively. Moreover, as conﬁrmed by atomic force microscopy (AFM), the substrate surfaces exhibit low roughness (~0.5 nm) after being polished using all of the prepared samples. Especially, the MRR of CeO2-Ar/H2 abrasives is increased by 104.76% compared with CeO2-air abrasives. The improved CMP performance is attributed to the increased Ce3þ concentration and the octahedral morphology of the abrasives enhancing the chemical reaction and mechanical removal at the abrasiveesubstrate interface.

## 1. Introduction

CMP (Chemical Mechanical Polishing)1 is a key technology in advanced semiconductor manufacturing processes.2 It mainly re- lies on chemical and mechanical synergy to realize the material's global ﬂattening.3 With the development of semiconductor process nodes, CMP technology has become more and more important and has become an indispensable planarization process for processes below 0.35 mm.4 The slurry and pad of the polishing in the CMP system are the main consumables, and the polishing slurry as an active material can signiﬁcantly affect the polishing performance.

Ceria is considered to be the most effective abrasive for polishing SiO2 substrates due to their unique physical and chemical proper- ties. With the increase in the number and density of multilayer wiring, the circle of CMP process steps has increased signiﬁcantly, and the impact on the yield of subsequent processes has become greater and greater. Therefore, it is a hot research topic to enhance the polishing efﬁciency by improving the chemical activity of the abrasive itself rather than increasing the polishing pressure (Higher downforce results in worse surface quality after CMP5). 


The “chemical tooth” theory proposed by Cook6 contributed to the study of the polishing mechanism of ceria-based abrasives. The formation and destruction of the CeeOeSi bond between CeO2 abrasives and SiO2 substrate is the key to realizing material removal. The role of Ce3þ in CeO2 abrasives in enhancing this re- action has been widely recognized by researchers. Srinivasan et al.7 discovered that Ce3þ on the surface of CeO2 abrasives is the key to achieving the removal of SiO2 materials. Kim et al.8 studied the polishing performance of CeO2 abrasives with different speciﬁc surface areas and concluded that the small-sized CeO2 has a higher

polishing rate due to the higher Ce3þ concentration on the abrasive surface. Therefore, the defects on the ceria surface can enhance the chemical activity of the abrasive, which improves the polishing performance. Doping is a common way to enhance the chemical activity of nanoceria. Younis et al.9 showed that Gd3þ doping enhanced the degradation performance of CeO2 particles on organic dyes, and the enhanced catalytic activity was attributed to the formation of surface defects on CeO2 induced by ion doping. Cheng et al.10 improved the polishing efﬁciency of CeO2 abrasives by modifying the surface of commercial particles by ion doping. Furthermore, Kim et al.11 directly synthesized La3þ doped nano-ceria by a traditional hydrothermal method and conﬁrmed the signiﬁcant effect of doped abrasives on enhancing CMP per- formance for SiO2 substrates. These results are attributed to the increased Ce3þ concentration on the CeO2 abrasive surface by ion doping. 


and Nd3þ 


In the chip manufacturing process, a ﬁne post-CMP cleaning process is also required to remove the impurity adhesion after CMP.12 The ion doping can increase the MRR, but post-cleaning of the wafer surface contaminated by impurity ions will become difﬁcult, which will affect the chip quality and even damage the device.13 Therefore, the preparation of CeO2 abrasives by control- ling atmospheric conditions without introducing impurity ions is an ideal way to increase the Ce3þ concentration on the abrasive surface. Choudhury et al.14 prepared cerium oxide particles with high oxygen vacancy concentration under vacuum conditions, which exhibited better catalytic performance than CeO2 prepared under air. Lan and Sohn15 studied cerium oxide prepared under different atmosphere conditions (Air, N2, H2), and the results showed that under a reducing atmosphere, cerium oxide has good catalytic performance due to the formation of more oxygen va- cancies. However, its wide particle size range and agglomeration behavior cannot be applied in the CMP ﬁeld. Moreover, the rela- tionship between the oxygen vacancies of CeO2 surface and Ce3þ concentration under the reducing atmosphere has not been deeply studied. To improve the polishing efﬁciency of conventional CeO2 abrasives on SiO2 substrates, the CeO2 abrasives were prepared by the molten salt method in Air, Ar, and Ar/H2 atmospheres, respec- tively, to clarify the inﬂuence of CeO2 abrasives prepared in different atmospheres on the polishing performance of SiO2 sub- strate. Through detailed characterization studies, the evolution of crystal structure and micro-morphological of CeO2 abrasives were analyzed. Although the effect of Ce3þ in CeO2 abrasives on polishing performance has been conﬁrmed, the relationship between the atmospheric environment and the formation of Ce3þ on the abra- sive surface remains to be further elucidated. In this work, the in- ﬂuence of reducing atmosphere on the concentration of Ce3þ on the abrasive surface was emphatically investigated. Moreover, the polishing performance of CeO2 abrasives prepared in reducing at- mosphere and air were compared, and the role of the prepared CeO2 abrasives on the removal efﬁciency of SiO2 substrate was investigated. Finally, the polishing mechanism of the CeO2 abra- sives was discussed through the comprehensive analysis of the morphology, defect characteristics, and polishing performance of the abrasives. To the best of our knowledge, the preparation of CeO2 abrasives by reducing the atmosphere-assisted molten salt method to enhance the CMP performance on SiO2 substrates has not been found to be reported yet. 


## 2. Experimental

## 2.1. Chemical reagents

Cerium nitrate hexahydrate (Ce(NO3)3,6H2O), potassium chlo- ride (KCl), and sodium chloride (NaCl) are all analytical reagents, 


1628 


and they were all purchased from Sinopharm Chemical Reagent Co., Ltd (China). Analytical reagent ethanol was purchased from Tianjin Fuyu Fine Chemical Co., Ltd. (China). Homemade deionized water was used throughout the experiment. All chemicals were used without further puriﬁcation. Ar (100% purity) and Ar/H2 (H2 con- centration of 5%) were used for the experiments. 


## 2.2. Preparation method

The molten salt method was used to prepare CeO2 powder, and the synthesis steps were as follows. Firstly, the weighed Ce(N- O3)3,6H2O (2.1711 g), KCl (1.8638 g), and NaCl (1.4610 g) were well ground in an agate mortar. The raw materials in ethanol were mixed completely by magnetic stirring at 300 r/min for 30 min. The mixture was transferred to an alumina crucible and dried in a constant temperature oven at 80 (cid:2)C to remove absolute ethanol. Then, the OTF-1200XeS tubular atmosphere furnace (Hefei Kejing Material Technology Co., Ltd., China) was used to prepare a mixture containing ceria powder under a certain temperature regime (react at 800 and 700 (cid:2)C for 2 h, respectively). After cooling down to ambient temperature, the molten salts (KCleNaCl) in the mixture were washed with hot deionized water to obtain high purity CeO2 powder. the crucible containing the mixture was heated in the tube furnace with a constant ﬂow (60 mL/min) of Ar or Ar/H2, respectively, and in the same temper- ature regime to explore the effect of the surrounding atmosphere. In this work, the abrasives prepared under air, Ar, and Ar/H2 at- mospheres were named CeO2-Air, CeO2-Ar, and CeO2-Ar/H2, respectively. 


In another experiment, 


## 2.3. Characterization methods

Powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns of the powders were recorded on a D8 Advance diffractometer (Bruker, Germany) under the condition of Cu Ka radiation range of 20(cid:2)e120(cid:2), and the scan- ning speed was ﬁxed at 3((cid:2))/min, the Rietveld reﬁnement of pow- ders was characterized using the GSAS program. Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectra were obtained using an FT-IR spectrometer (cid:3)1. The (Bruker, Germany) within the IR range of 500e4000 cm morphology of the powders was observed with a scanning electron microscope (SEM, Hitachi Regulus 8100, Japan) under secondary electronic mode. Detailed information on morphology and struc- ture was obtained by transmission electron microscopy (TEM, FEI Tecnai G2 F20, USA). Ultraviolet (UV)-visible spectra were recorded with a Cary 5000 UVeViseNIR spectrophotometer (Agilent Tech- nologies, USA). X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS, Thermo Scientiﬁc K-Alpha, USA) with Al Ka rays (hv ¼ 1486.6 eV) as the excitation source was used for analysis at room temperature, and the binding energy was calibrated with adsorbed carbon (284.8 eV), and the semi-quantitative analysis of the atomic ratio was achieved by measuring the element peak area. 


## 2.4. Polishing experiment

The homemade CeO2 abrasive was dispersed in deionized water using a ball mill and run at 400 r/min for 5 h. After sufﬁcient dispersion, the slurry was diluted with deionized water to make the solid content 0.5 wt%, and the pH was adjusted to 6.0 with 1 mol/L NaOH solution. The slurry was stirred well by using a magnetic stirrer before the start of the CMP experiment. The quartz glass with the nominal speciﬁcations of 20 mm diameter and 2 mm thickness was purchased from Lianyungang Xiongtai Quartz Tech- nology Co., Ltd. A UNIPOL-1200S automatic pressure grinding and polishing machine (Shenyang Kejing Auto-instrument, Co., Ltd., China) equipped with a synthetic leather polishing pad (Shenyang

Kejing Auto-instrument, Co., Ltd., China) was used for CMP exper- iments. The polishing parameters were set as follows: the platform speed was 80 r/min, the reverse speed of the polishing head was 80 r/min, the pressure applied by the head was 3.5 kg, and the pol- ishing time was 3 min, and the slurry supply rate was 50 mL/min. The polished quartz glass was cleaned repeatedly in deionized water by ultrasonic and dried for characterization of CMP perfor- mance. Surface morphology and roughness were examined by us- ing an atomic force microscope (AFM, Seiko SPA400-SP13800N, Japan) equipped with a silicon nitride tip in contact mode at a scan rate of 1.0 Hz over a scan area of 5 mm (cid:4) 5 mm. The weight of the workpiece was measured using a precision electronic balance with an accuracy of 0.1 mg. The polishing efﬁciency or material removal rate (MRR, nm/min) was calculated by the following Eq. (1).16: MRR ¼ m0 (cid:3) m r (cid:4) S (cid:4) t 


(1) 


where m0 and m are the mass of the workpiece before and after polishing, respectively, r is the density of the commercial quartz glass used (2.2 g/cm3), S the area of the workpiece (p$cm2), and t the polishing time (3 min). In this experiment, the MRR and roughness data presented are the average of three experiments performed repeatedly. 


## 3. Results and discussion

## 3.1. Morphology and structure characterization of CeO2 abrasives

The XRD patterns of the prepared CeO2 particles are recorded in Fig. 1. All diffraction peaks of the samples match well with the CeO2 phase of face-centered cubic (fcc) ﬂuorite (JCPDS 34e0394), and no other cerium oxides (Ce2O3 species) are found. The peak position analysis of each diffraction spectrum showed that the crystal structure of CeO2 prepared under different atmospheres changed. The magniﬁcation of the diffraction peaks shows that the diffrac- tion peak positions of the samples synthesized under Ar and Ar/H2 atmospheres are shifted to a higher angle, which may be due to the lattice contraction caused by more oxygen vacancies. The Rietveld reﬁnement of CeO2 samples was characterized using the GSAS program to further conﬁrm subtle changes in the structure of CeO2 particles, as shown in Figs. S1(aec). The Rietveld reﬁnement was attempted using a CeO2 phase with a face-centered cubic (Fm-3m) structure. The red circle, the black line, and the blue line represent the recorded, calculated and different proﬁles for the CeO2 powder, respectively. For all samples, the reﬁnement parameters (Rp < 7%, Rwp < 9%, and Chi2 < 2) are within a accepted range, indicating that the results of reﬁnement are credible. The results show that the lattice constants and volume of CeO2-Ar (0.54132 nm, 0.15862 nm3) and CeO2-Ar/H2 (0.54130 nm, 0.15860 nm3) are smaller than CeO2- 


Air (0.54137 nm, 0.15867 nm3). This further conﬁrms the formation of oxygen vacancies in the CeO2 crystal. The oxygen vacancies promote the conversion of Ce4þ for unit cell charge bal- ance,17 which is responsible for the increase in Ce3þ concentration in CeO2.18,19 


to Ce3þ 


The FT-IR spectra of the abrasives are shown in Fig. 2. The spectra were studied to characterize changes in chemical bonds and molecular vibrations, and evaluate the formation of the abra- (cid:3)1 is due to the pres- sives. The broad absorption band at 3456 cm ence of the HeOeH stretching mode attributed to the adsorbed water on the CeO2 abrasive surface.20e22 The bands at 2927 and (cid:3)1 indicate the CeH stretching mode of the methylene 2855 cm groups,21,23 and the peak intensity is weakened after synthesis by reducing atmosphere, which indicates that the adsorption of CO2 by (cid:3)1 CeO2 particles is reduced. The bands located at 2160 and 2028 cm are due to the stretching vibration of CeH, and CH2 groups, asso- ciated with some of the organic moieties which get physically adsorbed on the surface during sample preparation and handling.21 (cid:3)1 correspond to the CeeO The peaks between 1047 and 1630 cm stretching vibrations attributed to the hydrogenated CeO2 sam- ple.20,21 The enhancement of the vibrational peak with the reducing atmosphere indicates that the sensitivity of CeO2 abrasives to hy- droxyl groups is elevated, which favors the adsorption of abrasives to SiO2 substrates. Meanwhile, the existence of the peak at (cid:3)1 in the IR spectra is attributed to the asymmetric 716 cm stretching vibrations between OeCeeO atoms.23,24 Furthermore, it veriﬁes the bonding of metaleoxygen existing in the CeO2 lattice, which is consistent with the XRD results. 


Fig. 3 shows the SEM images of the CeO2 abrasives synthesized under different atmospheres. There are signiﬁcant differences in the morphology of the particles. From Fig. 3(aec), it can be seen that the CeO2-Air, CeO2-Ar, and CeO2-Ar/H2 abrasives are spherical, polyhedral, and octahedral, respectively. Fig. 3(d) shows the sche- matic diagram of the effect of the atmosphere on the morphology of the abrasives. It is considered that the morphology of CeO2 particles is gradually transformed from spherical to octahedral with the enhancement of the reducing atmosphere. The morphology of CeO2 abrasives is one of the factors affecting the CMP performance, and the detailed mechanism of the change of morphology of CeO2 particles during the synthesis will be focused on in our next study. SEM images also show that all abrasives are in the size range of 200e300 nm, which weakens the inﬂuence of abrasive size effect on CMP results. 


The TEM images were acquired to further observe the morphology and structure of CeO2 abrasives. Obviously, with the enhancement of reducibility, the morphology of CeO2 particles changes in Figs. S2(aec), the morphologies of CeO2 particles are spherical,

polyhedral, and octahedral in order, which is consistent with the SEM results. As shown in Figs. S2(def), the boundaries of CeO2 particles can be observed in the high-resolution TEM (HRTEM) images, and the clear lattice fringe spacing of CeO2-Air, CeO2-Ar, and CeO2-Ar/H2 particles are 0.318, 0.304 and 0.302 nm, respec- tively, which correspond to the CeO2 (111) plane. The results show that the spacing of CeO2 particles is slightly reduced with the enhancement of the reducibility of the atmosphere. This is attrib- uted to the lattice contraction caused by the generation of oxygen vacancies. 


UVeVis spectroscopy techniques can be used to obtain infor- mation on the oxidation state of metal oxide species. The infor- mation about the valence state of the Ce element in the prepared CeO2 samples was preliminarily analyzed by UVeVis spectros- copy.25 It is considered that the absorption peak of CeO2 at 260 nm is attributed to Ce3þ , and the absorption peak at 330 nm is attrib- uted to Ce4þ .26,27 Fig. 4 shows the UVeVis spectra of the as- prepared abrasives, CeO2-Ar and CeO2-Ar/H2 abrasives have high peak intensities, indicating that CeO2 abrasives prepared under a reducing atmosphere can increase the Ce3þ concentration.

XPS is an analytical technique that detects the composition, chemical state, and concentration of elements on the material surface. The surface chemical composition and valence states of the CeO2 samples were analyzed by XPS spectroscopy. Fig. 5(a) shows the XPS survey spectra of the particles. The spectra show that only Ce, O, and C elements are detected, and no Cl, Na, or K elements are present in the samples, which also indicates the synthesis of CeO2 as a single phase. Numerous studies28e32 have shown that the chemical activity of CeO2 material is closely related to the con- centrations of oxygen vacancy and Ce3þ . Therefore, the ﬁne spectra of Ce 3d and O 1s were analyzed in detail by ﬁtting. The spineorbit splitting energies of the samples are 18.44, 18.44, and 18.30 eV, respectively, which are consistent with the reports.33 The u and v are usually used to label the spin orbitals 3d3/2 and 3d5/2, where the v0, v', u, and u' peaks are characteristic peaks of Ce3þ and the v, v", v"', u0, u", and u"' peaks belong to Ce4þ .33,34 As shown in Figs. S3(aec), the nonlinear peak ﬁtting method was used to identify the peaks of Ce3þ , indicating the presence of both Ce3þ states in the samples. Table 1 shows the binding energies and peak areas of CeO2 samples (Air, Ar, Ar/H2) repre- senting different Ce states. Using the semi-quantitative analysis of the integrated peak area, the Ce3þ concentration could be calcu- lated according to Eq. (2).34 Fig. 5(b) shows the statistics of Ce3þ concentration on the CeO2 abrasive surface. In this work, the Ce3þ concentrations on the surface of CeO2-Air, CeO2-Ar, and CeO2-Ar/H2 abrasives were 23.03 at%, 29.58 at%, and 33.88 at%, respectively. The improvement of Ce3þ concentration on the abrasive surface in- creases with the enhancement of the reducing atmosphere, which was consistent with the UVeVis results. And this change indicates that there is a state transition between Ce4þ , which is excellent for enhanced polishing efﬁciency.

Figs. S3(def) display the XPS spectra of O 1s, which can be ﬁtted to three peaks. The peak named O1 can be attributed to lattice oxygen, and the binding energies of this peak for CeO2 samples prepared under different atmospheres are 529.43 eV (Air), 529.02 eV (Ar), 528.94 eV (Ar/H2), respectively.

at 691.28 nm/min under the same working conditions. The MRR of CeO2-Ar and CeO2-Ar/H2 abrasives increased by 71.43% and 104.76%, respectively, compared with CeO2-Air abrasives. These results reveal that the abrasives synthesized under a reducing at- mosphere have excellent polishing efﬁciency. In this work, the Ce3þ concentration and morphology of the CeO2 abrasives synthesized under different atmospheres showed a large variation. The trend of Ce3þ concentration is consistent with the improved MRR of abra- sives. It is generally accepted that the ﬂattening of rough surfaces involves chemical bonding and mechanical wear between the abrasives and the surface in CMP. Seo et al.29 believed that the Ce3þ concentration could improve the chemical adsorption capacity between the abrasives and the surface. Kim et al.37 believed that physical morphology is an important factor in enhancing polishing behavior. Therefore, the signiﬁcant enhancement of polishing efﬁ- ciency of CeO2-Ar and CeO2-Ar/H2 abrasives is attributed to the increase of Ce3þ concentration on the surface of the abrasives synthesized under the reducing atmosphere. Furthermore, the

(Ar/H2) are due to the adsorbed oxygen at the oxygen vacancy.35 In addition, the binding energies of the peaks representing weakly bound oxygen or chemisorbed oxygen peaks36 are 532.23 eV (Air), 532.23 eV (Ar), and 532.04 eV (Ar/H2), respectively. The peak po- sitions of CeO2-Ar and CeO2-Ar/H2 samples are shifted to relatively low binding energies, indicating that the reducing atmosphere has a signiﬁcant effect on the chemical environment of oxygen in CeO2 samples. The concentrations of oxygen vacancy on the abrasive surface can be obtained by calculating the integral ratio of the ﬁtted peak areas, which are 19.92 at% and 22.17 at% for CeO2-Ar and CeO2- Ar/H2 surfaces, much higher than CeO2-Air (17.81 at%). It conﬁrms that the preparation of CeO2 abrasives under a reducing atmo- sphere can effectively reduce the lattice oxygen and improve the oxygen defects on its surface. 


In a reducing atmosphere, the lattice oxygen is spilled out as neutral O2 molecules and oxygen vacancies are generated in the CeO2 lattice. The electrons released by the overﬂow of O2 molecules are bound around the oxygen vacancy. To keep the crystal electri- cally neutral, Ce4þ in the CeO2 crystal gains electrons and turns into the lower valence Ce3þ , the reaction of defect formation is shown in Eq. (3). As a result, more oxygen vacancies and Ce3þ were formed on the surface of CeO2-Ar and CeO2-Ar/H2 abrasives compared to CeO2-Air abrasives, which facilitated the polishing activity of CeO2- based abrasives.

substrates 


MRR is one of the important indicators to evaluate the polishing performance of abrasives. Fig. 6 illustrates the MRR of CeO2 abra- sives on SiO2 substrates, the MRR of CeO2-Air abrasives is the lowest at 337.60 nm/min, the MRR of CeO2-Ar abrasives is higher at 578.74 nm/min, and the MRR of CeO2-Ar/H2 abrasives is the highest

MRR of CeO2-Ar/H2 abrasives is improved by 19.45% compared with CeO2-Ar abrasives, which may be attributed to the octahedral morphology that enhances mechanical interaction during CMP. In addition, we collected the values of MRR for different types of CeO2- based abrasives in some works, as shown in Fig. S4. For the core/ shell abrasives, the present results show a poor MRR, although the structure of the abrasive has been designed and regulated to improve CMP performance, it is still far from being suitable for large-scale commercial use. For the doped abrasives, it is believed that the doping increases the Ce3þ concentration on the abrasive surface, which enhances the MRR. However, impurity ions of the abrasives during the polishing will pollute the surface of the sub- strate leading to difﬁculties in CMP cleaning, and residual impurity ions will negatively affect or even damage the device. Under the existing studies and applications, it is very feasible to enhance MRR by adjusting the physical properties (size and morphology) of pure CeO2 abrasive, but the improvement of the approach is limited. In this work, the pure CeO2 abrasives synthesized under a reducing atmosphere not only changed the morphology but also improved the chemical activity of the CeO2 abrasives, which together improved the removal efﬁciency. 


## 3.2.2. Surface quality of SiO2 substrates after CMP

To conﬁrm the effect of material surface quality after polishing with homemade abrasives. As shown in Fig. 7, the surface morphology of the quartz glass was characterized using AFM. The two-dimensional surface morphology of quartz glass before and after polishing are shown in Fig. 7(aed). The light and dark colors in the graph show the surface roughness, where dark areas indicate the valleys and light areas indicate the peaks. Concretely, the roughness average (Ra) and the root mean square roughness (Rq) of the surface are shown in Fig. 7(f). The initial roughness of quartz glass is 0.955 nm, and all of them are improved (0.391, 0.537, and 0.521 nm) after polishing with the CeO2 slurry, in which the pol- ishing slurry formulated with CeO2-Ar and CeO2-Ar/H2 abrasives 


synthesized under reducing atmosphere has poorer polishing performance in surface quality. The difference in surface quality after polishing may be caused by the different morphology of abrasives. The sharped morphology reduced contact areas between abrasives and surfaces, which leads to enhanced contact stress reducing the surface quality.38 As shown in Fig. 7(e), the proﬁle roughness in the selected area (the diagonal in Fig. 7(aed)) was also analyzed, where the Z-axis represents the depth of the line proﬁle, and the X-axis represents the length. The improved surface pla- narization degree can be conﬁrmed by reduced topographical variations. Moreover, compared with the initial surface, rough peaks or valleys are evenly distributed on the polished surface, which is conducive to the improvement of the overall surface quality. 


## 3.3. CMP mechanism of CeO2 abrasives prepared under reducing

atmosphere 


In this work, CeO2 abrasives were prepared under the reducing atmosphere. The surface quality of the SiO2 substrate was signiﬁ- cantly improved after polishing with the abrasives. In particular, the abrasives have excellent polishing efﬁciency, which is attrib- uted to a combination of the following factors. The analysis of the structure and chemical valence of the as-prepared CeO2 particles showed that the surface of the abrasive has a higher Ce3þ con- centration. The CMP performance also conﬁrmed that the polishing efﬁciency of the abrasives with a high Ce3þ concentration is signiﬁcantly improved. There may be a positive function between the Ce3þ concentration and MRR, which may be due to the electron transfer of Ce3þ promoting CeeOeSi bond breaking. Furthermore, the polishing results also show that the MRR of the CeO2-Ar/H2 abrasives is 19.45% higher than that of the CeO2-Ar abrasives even when the chemical activity (Ce3þ concentration) is similar, which may be attributed to the effect of abrasive morphology.

Fig. 8 is a schematic diagram of the polishing mechanism of CeO2 abrasives prepared under different atmospheres on the SiO2 substrate. The synergy of chemistry and mechanics in the CMP process is what makes the material surface ﬂat. The CeO2 abrasives not only have moderate mechanical properties but also provide chemical activity in the CMP process. As shown in Fig. 8(a), the CeO2 abrasives with nearly spherical morphology were prepared under air, and the contact stress is small under the downforce, which only removes the superﬁcial atoms on the surface. The spherical particles may have both sliding and rolling removal be- haviors on SiO2 substrates. The sliding friction behavior of abrasives is considered to be the main mode of material removal, while the rolling behavior of some abrasives weakens the material removal ability due to reduced friction. As shown in Fig. 8(b), the CeO2 abrasives with octahedral morphology were prepared under a reducing atmosphere. Its sharp edges enable the abrasives to have stronger compressive stress at the contact surface. On the one hand, it increases the material removal from the deeper layers of the substrate by the abrasives during the CMP, and on the other hand, the enhanced mechanical action further promotes the chemical reaction at the interface. As shown in Fig. S5, the stress distribution 


on the surface of the SiO2 substrate when the spherical and octa- hedral abrasives were indented at a depth of 50 nm was simulated by ﬁnite element analysis (FEA), respectively. The abrasives with octahedral morphology achieved the same indentation depth as spherical particles under lower compressive stress, which veriﬁes that the abrasives with octahedral morphology have a higher MRR. The chemical activity of the CeO2 abrasives is an advantage that distinguishes it from other abrasives, which signiﬁcantly enhances the CMP performance of the abrasives. As shown in Fig. 8(c), the CeO2 abrasives reacted with the SiO2 substrate to form CeeOeSi bonds in the slurry, the offset of the electron cloud strengthens the CeeOeSi bonds and weakens the SieOeSi bonds, then the surface layer of the substrate is removed by abrasives under the mechanical force. As shown in Fig. 8(d), Ce4þ on the surface of the CeO2 abra- sives is reduced to Ce3þ with higher reactivity under the reducing atmosphere. After the CeeOeSi bond is formed between the abrasives and the substrate surface, the free electrons in Ce3þ break the SieOeSi bond through electron transfer, which signiﬁcantly increases the material removal efﬁciency. 


In the CMP, the hydrated surface layer (Si(OH)4) is removed by the reaction or/and mechanical

abrasives.39 The material removal is closely related to the frictional effect of the two/three-body contact at the interface. In previous work,40,41 we indirectly used the CeO2 tip to study its frictional behavior. It is believed that studying the friction behavior of abra- sives with different properties at the interface is the key to quan- titatively analyzing the relationship between abrasives and MRR. In the next work, we will study the CMP behavior of CeO2 abrasives under multi-factors through a series of experiments and FEA. 


## 4. Conclusions

CeO2-Air, CeO2-Ar, and CeO2-Ar/H2 abrasives with different surface defect concentrations were prepared by reducing atmosphere-assisted molten salt method, which were used for CMP of SiO2 substrates. XRD and Rietveld reﬁnement conﬁrm that the CeO2 lattice shrinks due to the formation of oxygen vacancies with the enhancement of the reducing atmosphere. SEM images observe that the morphology of the abrasive prepared under a reducing atmosphere gradually changes from spherical to octahedral. The analysis of XPS patterns conﬁrms the higher concentration of de- fects on the surface of the abrasives prepared under a reducing atmosphere. CMP experiments on SiO2 substrates indicate that the prepared abrasives all signiﬁcantly improve the surface quality. Obviously, CeO2-Ar and CeO2-Ar/H2 abrasives have very strong polishing efﬁciency (578.74 and 691.28 nm/min), with MRR in- creases of 71.43% and 104.76%, respectively, compared to CeO2-Air abrasives. The enhanced polishing efﬁciency can be attributed to the elevated chemical activity (Ce3þ concentration) of the CeO2 abrasives prepared under the reducing atmosphere, which en- hances the chemisorption and bonding between the CeO2 abrasives and the SiO2 surface. The morphology of the abrasives further af- fects the MRR, where the sharp edges of the abrasives enhance the frictional behavior of the interface, thereby accelerating material removal. In this work, the CeO2 abrasive prepared in a reducing atmosphere has the advantages of high-speed polishing and improved surface quality, which can signiﬁcantly improve the CMP performance.
