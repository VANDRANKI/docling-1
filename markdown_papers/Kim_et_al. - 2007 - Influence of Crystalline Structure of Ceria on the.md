The structural characteristics of nanosized ceria particles were investigated to clarify the relationship between the structural characteristics of abrasives and the problem of residual particles in shallow trench isolation chemical mechanical planarization (cid:1)STI CMP(cid:2). The ceria particles were synthesized via a solid-state displacement reaction method, and their crystalline structure was controlled by regulating the oxygen partial pressure at the reaction site on the precursor. In a calcination process with a high (cid:2) because of the decarbonation of the oxygen concentration, the synthesized ceria particles had a cubic ﬂuorite structure (cid:1)CeO2 cerium precursor at a high oxygen partial pressure. The particles calcined with a low oxygen partial pressure had an included (cid:2). The ceria slurry prepared with the cubic CeO2 yielded a higher removal rate than the slurry prepared hexagonal structure (cid:1)Ce2O3 with the hexagonal Ce2O3. Furthermore, the ceria slurry with the cubic structured particles had less residual particles on the oxide ﬁlm than the slurry with the hexagonal structured particles. The resulting residual particles originated because Ce2O3 is easily agglomerated and adsorbed on the wafer surface due to the high surface activity resulting from the oxygen vacancy on the particle surface. © 2007 The Electrochemical Society.

In the manufacture of next-generation LSI devices, chemical me- chanical planarization (cid:1)CMP(cid:2) is a key process used for the pla- narization a multilevel interconnection.1-3 A wide range of global planarization is required to attain a sufﬁcient depth of focus (cid:1)DOF(cid:2) within the process margin of exposure equipment for the ﬁne process technology patterns. In the CMP process, slurry conditions are critical for the realization of high-quality wafer devices due to the chemical and mechanical in- teractions with the deposited ﬁlm surface. The required dimensions of current semiconductor devices are decreasing below 50 nm. Be- cause of this, a ceria-based slurry is widely used instead of other abrasive slurries in shallow trench isolation (cid:1)STI(cid:2) as well as inter- layer dielectric (cid:1)ILD(cid:2) CMP for the manufacture of dynamic random access memory (cid:1)DRAM(cid:2) and ﬂash memory devices, due to the good removal selectivity, chip uniformity, global planarity, and the high polishing efﬁciency of the oxide ﬁlm.4 However, the ceria slurry induces defects on the wafer surface because of the large, abrasive agglomerated particles resulting from poor dispersion stability. Dur- ing CMP, the agglomerated particles easily stick to the wafer sur- face, which results in residual particles and scratches on the wafer surface.5-9 In order to reduce the surface defects, particle agglom- the ceria eration should be prevented by the stabilization of suspension.10-12 In general, the dispersion stability can be improved by adding an adequate polymeric dispersant. However, the stabiliza- tion of the ceria suspension using a polymeric dispersant has limi- tations in successfully eliminating the agglomerated particles which can induce scratches on the wafer surface. Therefore, a new method which can prevent the agglomeration of the ceria particle must be proposed. In this study, we considered the intrinsic properties of the particles themselves as a critical factor to prevent agglomeration and adhesion on the wafer, and thus, an attempt to control the intrinsic properties of the ceria powder was made. Ceria powder has been synthesized by many different methods including wet precipitation, sol-gel, hydrothermal, mechanochemical, and solid-state displace- ment reactions (cid:1)calcinations(cid:2).4,13 The solid-state displacement reac- tion is widely used for the synthesis of ceria particles because the crystallite size of the particles can be easily controlled by varying the calcination conditions such as temperature, time, and oxygen vapor pressure.14,15 The removal rate of the oxide ﬁlm is propor- tional to the crystallite size of the ceria particles.15 The large crys- tallite size of the particles results from a high calcination tempera- ture and easily induces many scratches on the wafer surface. Thus, the synthesis of ceria particles at low temperatures is favorable in 


the CMP process. During the calcination, the by-product carbon dioxide is present around the precursor powder and this causes dif- fusion resistance for oxygen at the reaction site.16 It induces an oxygen vacancy within the ceria crystal lattice, which can result in variations of crystal structure. Therefore, in the low-temperature cal- cination process, the oxygen concentration in the furnace plays an important role in the synthesis reaction because of the acceleration of the decarbonation of the cerium precursor. 


In this study, the crystal structure of the ceria particles was con- trolled by varying the oxygen concentration. The inﬂuence of the crystalline structure of the ceria particles on both particle agglom- eration in the slurry and residual particles onto the oxide ﬁlm after CMP was investigated.

3, Juntai, China(cid:4) was employed as a starting material for the solid-state displacement reaction of the ceria particles. The precursor was calcined under air at 650°C for 4 h, which resulted in a white-yellowish ceria powder. In order to prepare two different crystal structures, the oxygen con- centration was controlled by adjusting the air inﬂow. The particles of samples A and B were synthesized with air ﬂows of 35 and 5 m3/h, respectively, and the particles of sample C were synthesized without air ﬂow. The crystallite size of the ceria particles was measured by the X-ray diffraction method (cid:1)RINT/DMAX-2500, Rigaku, Japan(cid:2) and calculated using the Debye–Scherer equation. The speciﬁc sur- face areas of the powders were estimated utilizing the Brunauer– Emmett–Teller (cid:1)BET(cid:2) method (cid:1)ASAP 2010, Micromeritics, USA(cid:2). By using nitrogen gas, the samples were outgassed at 250°C for 2 h prior to each analysis to remove physisorbed species from the pow- surface. Each calcined ceria powder underwent a wet- der mechanical milling process for several hours to reduce the particle size to the target size (cid:1)240–260 nm as determined by a conventional light-scattering method(cid:2) and to disperse the particles in an aqueous medium after mixing the powder with deionized water and a dis- persant composed of commercially available anionic acrylic poly- mers (cid:3)poly(cid:1)methyl methacrylate(cid:2), PMAA(cid:4). The solid content of the slurry was controlled to a weight fraction of 5%, and the suspension pH was adjusted to 8.4. After preparing the ceria slurry, two samples were dried to investigate the crystallite size and speciﬁc surface area. For each sample, the crystallite size and surface area are listed in Table I.

The diffraction patterns of the particles were also investigated using high-resolution TEM (cid:1)JEOL2010, Jeol, Japan(cid:2) to certify the crystalline structure and morphology of the ceria particles. Using the

nanobeam aperture (cid:1)nanobeam size = 3 nm(cid:2), the diffraction patterns (cid:1)spot patterns(cid:2) of the individual particles were obtained. 


To investigate agglomeration in the slurries, we measured the number of large particles over 1 (cid:1)m per unit volume by using a slurry particle counter (cid:1)Accusizer 780/FX, PSS/Nicomp, USA(cid:2). The particle counter is a type of large-particle counting equipment that optically detects single particles and counts the number of particles in the tail of a submicrometer distribution. The accuracy of this particle counter was veriﬁed with 1.59 (cid:1)m diam standard latex par- ticles. 


Field evaluation of CMP was done using two kinds of slurries. For the CMP evaluation, an 8 in. wafer CMP tool (cid:1)6EC, Strasbaugh, USA(cid:2) was used. The polishing pad was a grooved IC1000/SubaIV (cid:1)Rodel, USA(cid:2). The ﬁlm thickness was measured using a Nanospec 180 (cid:1)Nano-metrics, CA., USA.(cid:2) to calculate removal rates. For this experiment, the within-wafer nonuniformity (cid:1)denoted WIWNU(cid:2) was deﬁned as the standard deviation of the remaining thickness divided by the average of the remaining thickness after CMP. The residual particles and scratches on the oxide ﬁlm (cid:1)high-density-plasma SiO2 (cid:2) were measured using a Surfscan SP1 (cid:1)KLA-Tencor, USA(cid:2). After CMP, the wafers were cleaned using an ammonium hydroxide and hydrogen peroxide mixture (cid:1)APM(cid:2) solution (cid:1)NH4OH:H2O2:H2O = 1:1:10(cid:2) at 80°C to eliminate residual particles. The polishing test conditions are shown in Table II. 


Results and Discussion 


Particle and slurry characteristics.— Figure 1 shows the mor- phology and primary particle sizes of the ceria particles after me- chanical milling. The particle size distributions were found to be noticeably different between samples based on the TEM images. The portion of small-sized particles (cid:1)(cid:2)20 nm(cid:2) in samples B and C was larger than in sample A. The initial crystallite size of all as- calcined samples calculated by the Debye–Scherer equation was about 26 nm. However, the crystallite sizes of the particles after mechanical milling became 25, 21.5, and 20.3 nm for samples A, B, and C, respectively, which leads to a signiﬁcantly different speciﬁc surface area for each particle group. After mechanical milling, the particles in all samples had similar size, ranging from 240 to 260 nm. Therefore, the particles (cid:1)samples B and C(cid:2) which were calcined at low oxygen concentration are composed of a large num- ber of small crystallites (cid:1)20.3 and 21.5 nm(cid:2), while the particles

pore channels of the carbonate, adsorption, reaction with the cerium carbonate, and the desorption of the reaction by-product (cid:1)carbon dioxide(cid:2).16 In this reaction mechanism, several factors inﬂuence the physical properties of the synthesized particles during the calcina- tion process. According to previous reports, a low oxygen concen- tration results in a hexagonal phase cerium oxide rather than the cubic phase due to the insufﬁcient oxidation of Ce3+ to Ce4+.17 In the absence of an external oxygen supply, the hexagonal CeOx phase is reported to be observed between 400 and 500°C and the oxidation of CeOx is complete above 800°C, which results in the transforma- tion from hexagonal Ce2O3 to cubic CeO2.18 Therefore, the hexago- nal phase (cid:1)Ce2O3 (cid:2) in samples B and C was formed due to the in- sufﬁcient oxidation of Ce3+ to Ce4+, while the cubic phase (cid:1)CeO2 (cid:2) in sample A was obtained due to sufﬁcient oxygen supply. 


To investigate agglomeration in the slurries, we measured the number of large particles (cid:1)(cid:3)1 (cid:1)m(cid:2) per unit volume by using a slurry particle counter and the results are shown in Fig. 3. Samples B and C with a hexagonal crystalline structure have more larger agglomerated particles than sample A. Because the Ce3+ and oxygen vacancies in the surface of the hexagonal ceria particle are linked to anionic vacancies with hydroxyl groups, chemisorption and agglom- eration easily occurred with the neighboring cation-species and bared ceria surface.18,19 Moreover, samples B and C have many small particles, which were conﬁrmed to have a mainly hexagonal crystalline structure (cid:1)Fig. 3(cid:2). The van der Waals attractive force is well known to increase with decreasing particle size; therefore, the large agglomerated particles in samples B and C are attributed to the presence of small-sized particles. 


CMP performance.— CMP was performed with the ceria slurry which was prepared by adding an adequate amount of commercially available anionic acrylic polymers (cid:1)PMAA(cid:2). Cubic CeO2 (cid:1)sample A(cid:2) and CeO2 with included hexagonal Ce2O3 particles (cid:1)sample C(cid:2) were used as abrasive particles. The removal rate trends along the radius and WIWNU of the oxide ﬁlm are shown in Fig. 4. In Fig. 4a, there is a remarkable difference between the oxide ﬁlm removal rates of samples A and C. The removal rate of the oxide ﬁlm was dependent on the crystallinity of the ceria particles.15 The polishing of the oxide ﬁlm was mainly affected by the chemical interaction between the ceria particles and the oxide (cid:1)SiO2 (cid:2) ﬁlm, which reacted with the hydrated surface to form covalent bonds such as Ce–O–Si and then pulled off the oxide lumps.20,21 As shown in Fig. 1, the particles of sample A had a larger crystallinity and narrower particle size distri- bution than those of sample C. Because the hexagonal structured ceria particles and the agglomerated particles of sample C were

oxide, while samples B and C, which were calcined at a low oxygen concentration, included hexagonally structured particles, especially in the smaller particles. The calcination process from cerium carbon- ate to cerium oxide consists of a ﬁve-step mechanism and includes the mass-transfer of the reacting agent (cid:1)oxygen(cid:2) from the bulk at- mosphere to the periphery of carbonate, its diffusion through the

easily broken apart during the CMP process, these particles did not penetrate the viscous layer on the oxide ﬁlm.22 Thus, the removal rate of sample C was low, resulting in poor oxide due to nitride selectivity. The surface of the silicon nitride ﬁlm during polishing was passivated with an adsorptive surfactant in the slurry, which prevents the abrasive from directly contacting the ﬁlm surface.23,24 Hence, the removal rates for the Si3N4 ﬁlm were not inﬂuenced by the crystalline structure of the ceria particles. In addition, the slurry with agglomerated particles was hardly propagated over the whole wafer surface due to poor stability. Thus, as shown in Fig. 4b, sample C has a higher WIWNU and a lower removal rate of wafer edge position than those of sample A. 


During the CMP, the agglomerated particles were easily stuck to the wafer surface by the small interactive force between the abrasive and oxide ﬁlm. In particular, it is these sticking particles that induce the surface scratches on the wafer due to the compressive and shear forces between the wafer and pad. Therefore, agglomerated particles are a major cause for the residual particles and the microscratches in the CMP process. The maps of the residual particle counts and scratch counts are shown in Fig. 5a and b, respectively. The smaller particles observed in sample C had a high surface activity and spe- ciﬁc surface area. As shown in Fig. 5a, the residual particle counts of sample C are much larger than that of sample A. These residual particles induced the surface scratching during the CMP process. In Fig. 5b, the scratch counts of sample C are also larger than sample A. Consequently, the ceria powders that include hexagonal struc- tured particles were easily broken down into the smaller particles and induced particle adhesion on the wafer surface. Therefore, the ceria particles should be calcined to a cubic structure through con- trol of the oxygen concentration. 


# Conclusions

We have investigated the effects of the crystalline structure of nanosized ceria particles on the physicochemical properties of the ceria slurry and the residual particles and microscratches during STI CMP. The crystalline structures of the particles were remarkably different as a function of air inﬂow conditions. The particles cal- cined at a higher oxygen concentration were of a cubic structure (cid:2) but the particles calcined at a low oxygen concentration (cid:1)CeO2 (cid:2). The hexagonal structured included the hexagonal structure (cid:1)Ce2O3 particles had a smaller particle size than the cubic structured par- ticles. These smaller particles had a high surface area, which re- sulted in large attractive forces between particles. This caused a low removal residual particles, and surface scratches during STI CMP. Consequently, we concluded that the 


rate, high numbers of 


differences in the crystalline structure of the ceria particles had a profound effect on the dispersion stability and the residual particles after STI CMP.
