A high supersaturation value, S, establishes an environ- mental condition that favors homogeneous nucleation. Ho- mogeneous nucleation typically results in the formation of uniform nuclei with a critical size which can be calculated from:10

Nanometer cerium dioxide (CeO2) particles have been of great interest because of the signiﬁcant size-induced prop- erty changes, such as the Raman-allowed modes shifting and broadening;1,2 the lattice expansion;3 the pressure-induced phase transformation;4 the blue shift in ultraviolet absorption spectra.5 Very recently, we reported that lattice expansion of nanometer CeO2 single crystals was attributed to the higher defect concentrations of Ce31 and oxygen vacancies (V O ) 6 and the inﬂuences of the porosity on the changes of optical absorption in the porous ﬁlms prepared from nanometer CeO2 colloidal solutions.7 Moreover, nanocrystalline CeO2 particles allowed a sintering temperature of 1000 °C, which is 200– 400 °C lower than that reported for microcrystalline particles.8 In order to investigate the properties of nanocrys- talline CeO2 , it is extremely important to be able to synthe- size nanometer free surface particles with a narrow size dis- tribution and an average size about 4 – 5 nm. 9

It is the intent of this letter to describe a method for the synthesis of the nanometer single crystals, in which the crys- tal size was tailored in a semibatch reactor with control over the homogeneous nucleation and growth mechanisms achieved by high speed mixing with an impeller. In this case a high purity cerium nitrate solution was added into an aque- ous ammonium hydroxide precipitant. Oxygen was bubbled into the reactor with passage through a gas distributor to oxidize the Ce31 to Ce41. The as-synthesized particles were yellow with the ﬂow of oxygen whereas purple products were achieved without oxygen, which shows the possible mixture of Ce31 and Ce41 compounds. Moreover, the par- ticle size is smaller when oxygen bubble was used.8 Exces- sive precipitant was used so that the pH value was ’9 after the reaction was complete. Precipitates were dried at room temperature and directly yielded CeO2 particles. 


Figure 1 shows the pH value evolution during the pre- cipitation process; the pH value always remained higher than 9 ~i.e., @OH2# higher than 1025 mol/l!. The primary particle size is ’4 nm as determined from transmission electron mi- croscopy ~TEM!. Under these basic conditions, the solubility

precipitation process; again the crystallite size is ’4 nm. From Eq. ~2! then, the surface energy of the crystallites was calculated to be in the range of 2.8;3.7 J/m2. 


The nanometer scale particle size of the CeO2 prepared in this work is advantageous for applications where a ﬁne particle size is necessary ~e.g., catalysts!, and should allow for lower sintering temperature. Hence, how these powders coarsen with annealing temperature is of interest. Figure 3 shows the speciﬁc surface area ~SSA, m2/g) measured by the Brunauer–Emmett–Teller ~BET! method and corresponding particle size for annealing temperatures ranging from 150 to 1000 °C, all for a 1 h anneal time. The particle size ~d BET , mm! was calculated from the speciﬁc surface area data by assuming spherical particles with the relationship of d BET 56/(r (cid:149)SSA), using a value of the density for particles. The particle size slowly increased up to 500 °C, rapidly increased for temperatures greater than 600 °C, and achieved a size of 100 nm at 1000 °C. The speciﬁc surface area in this study is from higher literature.14 An Arrhenius plot of these data ~Fig. 4! revealed an interesting observation; two distinctly linear regions are apparent. Very recently, a similar behavior was observed for nanometer ZrO2 particles,9 in which a model of D(T) 5D 0 exp(2Ea(T)/T) was proposed, where D is the particle size; E a(T) is the temperature dependent activation energy; T is the temperature, and E a(T)/T is shown in Eq. ~3!:

a pH512, therefore the @OH2#51022 moles/l. The starting @Ce31# in the nitrate solution was 1021 moles/l. Some ques- tion related to the ‘‘local’’ @Ce31# will exist however, since there is no way of knowing for sure over what volume it diffused in the precipitant during the precipitation process. If it completely diffused in the reactor volume, the @Ce31# 51024 mole/l, corresponding to S51.431010; whereas S 51.431013 in the case of complete segregation of Ce31. In the case of adding ammonium aqueous solution into cerium nitrate solution, the solubility product, @Ce31#@OH2# 3, is less than the critical solubility constant of Ce(OH) 3 , due to a low pH value of cerium nitrate solution (pH’3.8). Under these conditions then, even though a nucleus may form at the interface, it is in an unstable state because of the low pH value of the bulk solution. The redissolution process is called ripening, which resulted in the particle with random size and morphology. 


In this work the primary particle size was constant over a wide of range of experimental precipitation conditions, supporting the assumption that homogeneous nucleation took place. Figure 2 is the image of the particles after only a 1 s

Nanocrystal sizes were deter- mined by electron microscopy and speciﬁc surfaced area of as-synthesized particles. Modeling revealed that the surface energy of as-synthesized nanometer crystallites was in the range of 2.9 to 3.7 J/m2. Crystal growth mechanisms change over the temperature regimes, perhaps from boundary diffu- sion controlled over the low temperature region to lattice diffusion at higher temperatures.

phous to crystallite state provides a large driving force for diffusion and subsequent growth at higher temperatures. Simple atomic rearrangement and ordering can result in a slow increase in particle size. Typically boundary diffusion has a lower activation energy than the other mechanisms,10,15 so it is possible this is the dominant mechanism at low tem- peratures. At higher annealing temperatures bulk diffusion controls the particle size evolution because of the higher ac- tivation energy associated with long range ordering and par- ticle rearrangement. Grain growth over the high temperature regime in thin CeO2 ﬁlms16 exhibits a similar behavior, which is also shown in Fig. 4; the activation energy was around 1.1 eV for thin ﬁlm, whereas only ;0.50 eV for nanocrystal growth. 


In conclusion, nanometer ~about 4 – 5 nm! CeO2 single crystals were synthesized by homogeneous nucleation at
