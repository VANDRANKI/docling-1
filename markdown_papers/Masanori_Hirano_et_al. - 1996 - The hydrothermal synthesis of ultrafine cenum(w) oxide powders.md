Hydrothermal  synthesis  is  an  attractive  method  for the  preparation  of crystalline  ceramic  oxide  powders and  has  been  employed  for  the  synthesis  of  fine powders  [1].  CeO2  is  one  of  the  highly  refractory oxides  and  is  difficult  to  sinter  to  a  high  density without  sintering  aids,  therefore  CeO2  needs  to  be produced  as  a  fine  powder  for  good  sinterability.  Up to  now,  few  attempts  have  been  made  for  the preparation  of  fine  CeO2  particles.  Matijevic  and Hsu  [2]  showed  that  the  crystalline  compound  of  a hydroxyl  carbonate  compound  (Ce20(CO3)2H20) with  a  spherical  shape  was  precipitated  in  a  urea solution  and  the  compound  was  converted  to  cubic 
[3]
CeO2  with  calcination  at  400 °C.  Chu  et  al. studied  the  sintering  of the  cerium-containing  parti- cles  obtained  from urea  solutions.  Chen  and  Chen  [4] reported  the  preparation  of fine  CeO2  powders  using the  homogeneous  precipitation  method  and  a  hexa- methylenetetramine  (HMT).  In  accordance  with  the hydrothermal  synthesis,  Tani  et  al.  [5]  studied  the effect  of mineralizers  on  the  crystallization  of  CeO2 under  hydrothermal  conditions  at  500-600  °C  and 100 MPa.  Zhou  and  Rahaman  [6]  investigated  the sintering  of  ultrafine  hydrothermally  synthesized CeO2  powders.  However,  the  factors  affecting  the hydrothermal  process  have  not  been  clarified. 


In  the  present  study,  ultrafine  CeO2  powders  were synthesized  in  the  presence  of  an  excess  amount  of ammonia  in  an  autoclave  at  150-200 °C.  The  effects of  treatment  temperature, treatment  time  and  the concentration  of  the  starting  solution  on  the  crystal growth  of  CeO2  under  hydrothermal  conditions were  investigated. 


in  a  stainless  steel 


The  solutions  of  cerium(w)  sulphate  tetrahydrate, Ce(SO4)2-4H20,  were  stirred  well  and  an  excess amount  of  ammonia solution  was  added.  The resulting  precipitate,  which  was  prepared  in  20 ml Teflon  bottles  without  separating the  precipitate from  its  mother  liquor,  was  sealed  with  a  cap  and placed laboratory  autoclave vessel,  which  was  heat  treated  for  a  specific  time  at 150-200 °C.  The  products  prepared  by  the  hydro- thermal  treatment  were  washed  with  distilled  water, dried  in  air  and  characterized  using  X-ray  diffrac- tometry  (XRD)  and  transmission  electron  micro- scopy  (TEM).  The  crystallite  sizes  of  the  phases were  calculated  from  the  Scherrer  formula  using  the (220)  diffraction  peak  of  CeO2. 


The  results  of  the  experiment  on  the  effect  of treatment  temperature  on  the  hydrothermal  products are  shown  in  Fig.  1.  The  XRD  patterns  show  all  of the  major fluorite structure  with  no  sign  of  an  amorphous  form.  It

The  particle  size  of  the  powder  synthesized  at the 150°C  for  20h  was  3nm,  which  confirms original  Scherrer  X-ray  line-broadening  estimate.

The  XRD  profiles  of  the  powders  synthesized from  various  concentrations  of  cerium(Iv)  sulphate solutions  are  shown  in  Fig.  4.  The  crystallinity  and crystallite  size  of  the  synthesized  powders  depend on  the  concentration  of the  solution.  As  the  ceriurn sulphate  in  the  starting  solution  was  concentrated, the  CeO2  peaks  became  sharper.  From  these  results, the  conditions for  synthesizing  ultrafine  C e Q powders  under  hydrothermal  conditions  have  been clarified.
