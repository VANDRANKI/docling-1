is widely used as both a Ceria (cerium oxide) refractory material polishing compound and a because of its hardness and stability at high temperatures. Recently, ceria ﬁne particles have been used in fuel battery materials and various sensor materials [1]. The size requirements of the ceria ﬁne particles depend on the particular application, but, in general, it is desirable for the particles to have a narrow size distribution. For polishing applications, particle sizes tend to be of sub-micrometer order whereas for ceramic materials, particle sizes are typically of nanometer order [2].

Ceria ﬁne particles can be produced by thermal decomposition [3–4], ﬂash combustion [5–6], sol– gel [7–8], precipitation [2] and hydrothermal syn- thesis [9–11] methods. Products formed by thermal decomposition and combustion give large aggrega- tions of nearly 10 (cid:236)m, making these techniques difﬁcult to adapt to nanometer particle production. For the case of sol–gel and precipitation, calcination temperatures gels of

to produce cerium oxide, additional treatment (a grinding and classiﬁcation) is necessary to obtain ultra-ﬁne particles with narrow size lower distribution [8]. Hydrothermal synthesis at temperatures (, 300 8C) is a well-known method for metal oxide ﬁne particles [9–11]. Hydrothermal synthesis does not require calcination and can produce nanometer-size particles. However, hydro- thermal techniques require long heat treatment for several hours because of the slow reaction rate.

We have proposed a rapid and continuous method for production of metal oxide particles using super- critical water as the reaction media [12–13]. The results of those studies suggest that the method has potential to change particle morphology and particle size because of its controllable thermodynamics and transport properties. Through these studies, we also found that ultra-ﬁne particles could be preferentially produced. This letter focuses on the production of ultra-ﬁne ceria particles by the supercritical water (SCW) hydrothermal synthesis method. 


Aqueous cerium nitrate solution (0.05 mol=L) was prepared by dissolving Ce(NO3)3·6H2O (Kanto Chemicals Inc., Tokyo) into distilled water. Fig. 1 shows the schematic diagram of the experimental apparatus. Cerium nitrate aqueous solution was fed by a high-pressure pump (NP-AX-15, Nihon Sei- mitsu Kagaku, Tokyo) with a ﬂow rate of 2 cm3=min. The solution was mixed with pre-heated

water ((cid:24) 450 8C), which was fed through another line at a ﬂow rate of 6 cm3=min. The solution was rapidly heated to the desired reaction temperature at the mixing point, and the reaction occurred. The reactor was maintained at the reaction temperature by an external heater. At the outlet of the reactor, the solution was cooled by a water jacket. Pressure in the system was held at 30 MPa with a back pressure regulator (Model 26-1722-24, Tescom Corp., Elk River) at the exit. Residence time of the solution in the reactor was varied by changing reactor volume, which was set to be 0:15 (cid:24) 7:7 cm3. The residence time was evaluated from the reactor volume, density of pure water at the reaction temperature and pressure and total ﬂow rate, where the density of solution was assumed to be that of pure water and density at pressure. 


the given system temperature 


Particle-water suspensions recovered were ﬁltered with a membrane ﬁlter (0.1 (cid:236)m), and then the powders were oven-dried at 60 8C for 24 h. Observa- tion of particle morphology, and measurement of particle size and particle size distribution, was per- formed with scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM)(H- 8010, Hitachi, Tokyo). The crystal structure of the powders obtained was analyzed by X-ray diffraction (XRD) using CuKÆ radiation (Model 2013, Rigaku, Tokyo). XRD analysis was also used to determine

Table I summarizes the experimental conditions and results. At 200 8C, the outlet solution was clear, but it appeared as a particle-water suspension at higher temperatures (. 250 8C). From the results of XRD analysis, products were CeO2. Above the critical temperature (374 8C), conversion of cerium reaction time (0:4 (cid:24) 0:6 nitrate at the seconds) was nearly 100%. This implied that hydrolysis reaction was complete and that a great amount of monomers were produced within an extremely short time.

In comparing results under various 


reaction temperatures, particle sizes became much smaller at temperatures higher than the critical point of water (374 8C). Regarding particle growth during the observation period, particles became larger with increasing residence time at subcritical conditions, whereas particles grew little under supercritical conditions. 


Fig. 2 shows SEM photographs of ceria particles obtained at various residence times at 300 8C. At 300 8C, characteristic octahedron ceria particles were produced. Particles grew with increasing residence time, as shown in Fig. 2 and also Table I. At 400 8C, products formed an aggregation on the membrane ﬁlter and had a size of 70 (cid:24) 120 nm, as shown in the SEM photograph in Fig. 3. Fig. 4 shows a TEM photograph of the same products. Ultra-ﬁne particles of about 20 nm with an octahedron shape were observed. From the XRD analysis with Sharer’s formula, the crystalline size of these products was about 20 nm and did not vary with increasing

residence time in the range of 0.4 to 20.4 s, as shown in Table I. 


We found that ultra-ﬁne ceria particles could be produced rapidly (, 1 s) under supercritical condi- tions. Although a detailed mechanism cannot be clariﬁed at the formation of ultra-ﬁne particles in supercritical water seems to be attributed to the extremely high hydrolysis reaction rate and the low solvent power of supercritical water that most likely leads to a high degree of supersaturation.
