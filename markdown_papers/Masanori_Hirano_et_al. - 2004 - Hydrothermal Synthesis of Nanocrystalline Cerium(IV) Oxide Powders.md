Nanocrystalline cerium(IV) oxide (CeO2) powders were prepared by heating solutions of cerium(IV) salts in the presence of urea under hydrothermal conditions at 120° to 180°C. The effects of the concentration of urea and hydro- thermal treatment temperature on the morphology and crystallite size of the synthesized particles were investi- gated. The synthesized particles were angular, ultrafine CeO2, with a cubic fluorite structure. Their crystallite size decreased from 20 to 10 nm with increasing urea concen- tration from 2 times to 8 times that of the Ce4+ ion. The size only slightly changed by calcining at temperatures below 600°C.

# Introduction

CERIA (CeO2) has been considered a useful material and 


attracted interest in an application for catalytic supports (for automotive exhaust systems).1,2 Several rare-earth-doped cerium oxides exhibit high oxygen ionic conductivity which makes them interesting materials for applications as solid elec- trolytes in solid oxide fuel cells.3,4 Ceria has a fluorite structure that is stable from room temperature to its melting point as compared with other pure oxides with oxygen ion conductivity, zirconia, and bismuth oxide, which have polymorph transfor- mations in different temperature ranges. This material has also received attention for other various applications such as addi- tives for glass, stabilizers for ZrO2, glass polishers, and so on. There is current interest in using hydrothermal routes to synthesize materials at relatively low temperatures. The hydro- thermally synthesized powder has excellent homogeneity and particle uniformity. Several techniques that include hydrother- mal synthesis,5–8 urea-based homogeneous precipitation,9–12 hexamethylenetetramine-based homogeneous precipita- tion,13,14 coprecipitation,15,16 decomposition of oxalate precur- sors,17 forced hydrolysis,18 and electrochemical synthesis19 have been developed for the production of ceria or cation- doped ceria particles and their precursors. The sintering behav- ior of CeO2 and Y2O3-doped CeO2 particles that were hydro- thermally synthesized from Ce(NO3) solution and ammonium hydroxide solution has been reported by Zhou and Rahaman.6 Tani et al.5 studied the effect of mineralizers on the crystal growth of CeO2 under hydrothermal conditions at 500–600°C and 100 MPa. It was also shown that controlling the growth of CeO2 particles was possible, and ultrafine ceria particles could be hydrothermally prepared from Ce(IV) sources.7,8 Studies on the synthesis of Y2O3–ZrO2 powders by the hydrothermal tech- nique in the presence of urea have also been reported.20,21 These crystalline powders had a 11.6 nm crystalline size and consisted of metastable cubic zirconia. However, few research- ers have reported the hydrothermal synthesis of powders in the presence of urea except for 3 mol% Y2O3–ZrO2 powder.

The purpose of the present work is to report the synthesis of ultrafine CeO2 powders under hydrothermal conditions in the presence of urea and investigate the effects of the concentration of urea and hydrothermal treatment temperature on the mor- phology and crystallite size of the synthesized particles. 


II. Experimental Procedure 


(1) Preparation 


Cerium(IV) sulfate tetrahydrate (Ce(SO4)2 


?4H2O, Kishida), ?2H2O, cerium(IV) ammonium sulfate dihydrate (Ce(NH4)4(SO4)4 Nacalai), and urea (CO(NH2)2, Nacalai) were of laboratory purity and used as the starting materials. A given quantity (20 cm3) of mixed solution of the cerium salt and urea in the desired concentrations was poured into a Teflon bottle with an inner volume of 25 cm3 held in a stainless-steel vessel. After the vessel was sealed, it was placed in a thermostatted oven, heated, and constantly rotated at 120° to 180°C for 5 h. The precipitated powders were then washed and dried in an oven with an air atmosphere. The calcination of the powders was carried out at 300° to 900°C for 1 h in a furnace with an air atmosphere. 


(2) Measurements 


The crystalline phase identification was performed by the X-ray diffraction (XRD) method using CuKa radiation. The crystallite size was estimated by line broadening analysis. The reflection from the (220) plane was used for the crystallite size determinations. The precipitate morphology and size were ex- amined by transmission electron microscopy (TEM) (Model JEM-200CX, JEOL, Tokyo, Japan). Specific surface areas of the as-synthesized and calcined powders were determined by the BET method. 


III. Results and Discussion 


Ce(SO4)2 


?4H2O solution (0.1 mol?dm−3) was hydrother- mally treated in the presence of urea (0.3 mol?dm−3) at 180°C for 5 h. The XRD data of the synthesized particles were char- acteristic of CeO2 with a fluorite structure. Similar CeO2 par- ?2H2O solu- ticles were also synthesized from Ce(NH4)4(SO4)4 tions under the same conditions. Figure 1 shows the morphology of the synthesized CeO2 particles as viewed by TEM. It reveals that the particles are angular and very fine. They appear to be cubic or octahedral and ranged in size from 10 to 25 nm. They must be single CeO2 crystals based on the fact that their particle size is in good accordance with the crystallite size determined by the XRD line broadening analy- sis. Their particle size is coarser than those (3 nm in size) hydrothermally prepared from the same cerium(IV) salt solu- tion with an excess amount of ammonia solution for the same treatment temperature and holding time.7,8 The number of nucleations of the hydroxide from the solution using urea may be fewer than those from the solution using an excess amount of ammonia. The morphology and size of the particles obtained in this study are similar to those hydrothermally prepared from the cerium(III) salt solution with an excess amount of ammonia solution rather than those from the cerium(IV) salt solution.8 It is noteworthy that there is a large difference in the size of the

particles prepared from the same cerium(IV) salt solution be- tween ammonia and urea which is used as the ligand source for ammonia. 


In the present study, the precipitate formed by heating the solutions of cerium(IV) salts in the presence of urea under hydrothermal conditions was not cerium carbonate but CeO2. Urea produces ammonium and cyanate ions: (cid:219) NH4

In an acidic solution, cyanate ions rapidly react according to 


OCN - + 2H+ + H2O (cid:221) CO2 + NH4

In neutral and basic solutions, carbonate ions and ammonia are formed: 


OCN- + OH+ + H2O (cid:221) NH3 + CO3 2- 


Because of their lower basicity and higher charge, Ce4+ ions usually undergo strong hydration and form hydroxide at low pH (PH 1,22 3.023). The hydrated Ce4+ ions can form com- plexes with H2O molecules or OH− ions.

Further polymerization is likely, and both can serve as precur- sors for the final oxide. In aqueous solution, H2O as polar molecules tend to take protons away from the hydroxide. ?n(H2O) + H3O+ (4- y)+ + H2O (cid:221) CeO2 In this way, Ce4+ ions precipitate as CeO2 before reacting with 2− ions. On the other hand, Ce3+ ions precipitated as two the CO3 types of cerium carbonate particles.24

The effect of hydrothermal treatment temperature on the crystallite size of the CeO2 particles based on the XRD line- broadening analysis of the (220) peak of the powder hydro- thermally synthesized for 5 h from 0.1 mol?dm−3 cerium(IV) sulfate solution in the presence of 0.4 mol?dm−3 urea is sum- marized in Fig. 2. The crystallite size increased with the hy- drothermal treatment temperature. It appeared that the hydro- treatment at higher temperature promoted the thermal crystallization and crystal growth of CeO2 from those hydrated ?n(H2O) species according to the Ce(OH)y(H2O)x dissolution–precipitation mechanism.

Figure 3 shows the effect of urea concentration on the mor- phology and the particle size of the CeO2 formed from the 0.1 mol·dm−3 Ce(SO4)2 solution under hydrothermal conditions at 180°C in contrast with Fig. 1. It was observed that the crys- tallinity and particle size of the synthesized ceria decreased with an increase in the urea concentration as seen from these examples. Figure 4 indicates the dependence of the crystallite size of the synthesized CeO2 particles on the concentration of urea. The pH of the solutions after hydrothermal treatment containing 0.2 mol?dm−3 and 0.4 mol?dm−3 urea was 2.7 and 7.8, respectively. It is likely that the increase in crystallite size is due to a decrease in the nucleation in the acidic solu- tion as the solution becomes acidic by a decrease in the urea concentration. 


The effects of calcining temperature on the specific surface area and crystallite size of the CeO2 particles are shown in Fig.

12.5 nm, and it scarcely changed by calcining at a temperature below 600°C. A significant increase in the crystallite growth of the particles occurred at temperatures above 700°C. The spe- cific surface area of the as-synthesized powder was 80 m2/g, and the change with heat treatment temperature showed good agreement with the change in the crystallite size. 


IV. Conclusions 


Nanocrystalline CeO2 powders, with a particle size of 10–25 nm, were synthesized by heating solutions of cerium(IV) salts in the presence of urea under hydrothermal conditions at 120° to 180°C. The particle size was controlled by adjusting the concentration of urea and the hydrothermal treatment tempera-
