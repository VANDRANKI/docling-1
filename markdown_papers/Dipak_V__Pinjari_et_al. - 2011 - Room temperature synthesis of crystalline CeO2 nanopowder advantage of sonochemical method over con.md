Keywords: Ceria (CeO2) Nanomaterial Sonochemical (acoustic cavitation) method 


In the present study, nano-sized ceria (CeO2) powders were prepared using conventional and sonochem- ically assisted precipitation method, without any stabilizers, using cerium nitrate as a starting material and sodium hydroxide as a precipitating agent. The synthesized ceria powders were characterized by XRD, TGA and SEM to determine crystallite size, % crystallinity, thermal weight loss and shape respec- tively. It was found that the crystallite size obtained in both the synthesis methods were below 30 nm. It was also found that sonochemical synthesis method is energy efﬁcient method saving more than 92% of energy as compared to that utilized by the conventional synthesis method. There was also a sig- niﬁcant reduction in the reaction duration.

## 1. Introduction

Ceria i.e. cerium dioxide (CeO2), a crystalline materials, is a ma- jor compound in the useful rare earth family, and has received more attention in recent years due to many distinctive characteris- tics, such as unique ultraviolet radiation absorbing ability [1], high stability at higher temperature, high hardness index and its reac- tivity [2]. The ceria powders have been commercially developed to be used in various applications, like glass polishing material 
[3], catalytic support or promoter [4], oxygen ion conductor in so-
lid oxide fuel cells (SOFCs) [5], gas sensor [6], UV absorbent [1] and abrasives of the CMP slurry in semiconductor fabrication [7]. Sev- eral researchers have published reports on the synthesis of ceria by using different methods such as sol–gel process [8,9], hydrother- mal or solvothermal synthesis [10–14], forced hydrolysis [15], microemulsion [16], precipitation [17–20], etc. Different precur- sors [21–23] have also been used for the synthesis of ceria powder such as Ce2O(CO3)2(cid:2)H2O, Ce(NO3)3(cid:2)9H2O3, and Ce(NO3)3(cid:2)6H2O. Yin et al. [24] have reported sonochemical synthesis of ceria powder using different stabilizers, solvents and cosolvents. 


The sonochemical method has been proved to be a useful method to obtain novel materials [25,26]. The chemical effects of ultrasonic irradiation arise from acoustic cavitation, in other words, the formation, growth and implosive collapse of bubbles in a liquid medium, which results in an instantaneously high tem- perature and pressure pulse [27,28]. These special conditions of high temperature, pressure and local intense micromixing attained

during acoustic cavitation lead to many unique properties in the irradiated solution and particles suspended in the same [29]. 


In this paper, ceria nanopowder was synthesized using conven- tional (NUS) and sonochemical (US) assisted precipitation tech- nique. The effect of ultrasound on % crystallinity, crystallite size, % weight loss and morphology of the synthesized CeO2 has been studied to understand the advantage of ultrasound (input ultra- sonic energy) in the synthesis of CeO2.

## 2.3. Synthesis of CeO2 by conventional method (NUS)

Cerium nitrate hexahydrate, 0.9 g (0.1 gmol) was dissolved in 30 ml distilled water and 0.24 g, (0.3 gmol) sodium hydroxide was dissolved in 30 ml distilled water separately and was kept ready. The sodium hydroxide solution was then added drop wise to the cerium nitrate hexahydrate solution under constant stirring using a magnetic stirrer (Model RQ1210, Remi Metals Gujarat Lim- ited, India). The aqueous clear solutions turned yellowish white initially but as the reaction proceeds, it converts into light yellow colloidal suspension. The reaction was allowed to proceed for 4 h after the complete addition of sodium hydroxide solution under stirring at room temperature (35 ± 2 (cid:3)C). The temperature of the reaction mixture was maintained at 35 ± 2 (cid:3)C by circulating water in jacketed reactor which was used for the synthesis work. The addition time of sodium hydroxide solution was about 2 min. After 4 h, the solution was centrifuged at 12000 rpm for 10 min to sepa- rate the product and the settled product was washed thrice using distilled water to remove the byproducts. After complete washing, the product was dried at 100 (cid:3)C for 3 h to complete the conversion of Ce(OH)3 to CeO2. After complete conversion, CeO2 powder ob- tained was (light yellowish in nature), cooled, ground by mortar, checked for yield and characterized by XRD, TGA and SEM analysis. The synthesis of CeO2 material by conventional method (NUS) was replicated thrice and the results were computed by averaging the individual results and were displayed with error bar (± variation) for % yield, % crystallinity and crystallite size. 


## 2.4. Synthesis of CeO2 by sonochemical method (US)

Cerium nitrate hexahydrate, 0.9 g (0.1 gmol) was dissolved in 30 ml distilled water and 0.24 g, (0.3 gmol) sodium hydroxide was dissolved in 30 ml distilled water separately and was kept ready. The sodium hydroxide solution was then added drop wise to the cerium nitrate hexahydrate solution under sonication using an Ultrasonic Horn (ACE 22 kHz) at 40% amplitude for 2 min with a 5 s pulse and 5 s relaxation cycle at time t = 0 h. Care was taken to see to it that the addition was done in conjunction with the sonic pulse afforded by the transducer (Horn). After addition, the solu- tion was again exposed to acoustic cavitation (by using ultrasonic horn) for further 18 min, by keeping all sonication parameters con- stant (same as that was used during mixing), to carry out the com- plete reaction of cerium nitrate hexahydrate with sodium hydroxide. The temperature of the reaction mixture was main- tained at 35 ± 2 (cid:3)C by circulating water in jacketed reactor which was used for synthesis work. The rest of the procedure was the same as described before in Section 2.3.

## 3. Characterizations

The dried CeO2 samples (powder form) were ﬁrst characterized by studying their X-ray Diffraction patterns on a Rigaku Mini-Flex X-ray Diffractometer. XRD patterns were recorded at angles be- tween 2(cid:3) and 80(cid:3), with a scan rate of 2(cid:3)/min. Particle sizes were determined using the Debye–Scherrer equation. Thermogravimet- ric analysis (TGA) studies were performed using Thermal Analyser (TA Instruments, USA). The sample was heated in N2 atmosphere in alumina crucible at the rate of 20 K/min. Sample preparation for Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) includes the deposition of platinum on CeO2 powder. Scanning Electron Microscopy of the samples was carried out on a JOEL JSM 680LA 15 kV SEM to esti- mate the surface characteristics of the sample. Together, the XRD and SEM methods are expected to provide exact knowledge regarding the particle size and crystalline characteristics of the synthesized CeO2. 


## 4. Results

## 4.1. Yield and reaction time

It is already mentioned in Sections 2.3 and 2.4 that the reaction time taken for the conventionally synthesized CeO2 was 4 h while reaction time taken for sonochemically synthesized CeO2 was 20 min. It was found that 4 h time is optimum for NUS synthesized CeO2 chalcone as the further enhancement in the % yield was not observed while in case of US synthesized CeO2 20 min was opti- mum reaction time to get the highest yield (Fig. 2). The percentage yield of the reaction was estimated on the basis of initial weight of the raw materials taken and ﬁnal weight of product obtained after the complete drying (compared to the stoichiometrically expected quantity). During the washing of synthesized CeO2 material, unre- acted raw materials present in the reaction and byproduct formed was separated. It was observed that yield of the reaction in the case

D.V. Pinjari, A.B. Pandit / Ultrasonics Sonochemistry 18 (2011) 1118–1123 


of sonochemically (US) synthesized CeO2 (70.12 ± 1%) was higher than in the case of conventionally (NUS) synthesized CeO2 (53.67 ± 1.74%). The error (± variation) is less than 2% for conven- tionally (NUS) synthesized CeO2 and 1% for sonochemically (US) synthesized CeO2. The impact of acoustic cavitation was evident in not only in the increased yields (yield is increased by 30% with a saving of 220 min reaction time) but also the reduction in aver- age particle size (Table 1). This is due to the rapid micromixing and resulting faster reaction (also possibly due to the formation of hot spots) to form nano CeO2. The reason for this is probably the fast kinetics of the US reaction providing not enough time for particle nucleation and growth and thus a reduced average particle size. 


## 4.2. Crystallinity and crystallite size of CeO2

X-ray diffraction is a versatile, non-destructive analytical method for identiﬁcation and quantitative determination of various crystalline forms, known as ‘phases’ of compound present in powder and solid samples. Diffraction occurs as waves interact with a regular precipitated solid matrix structure whose repeat distance is about the same as the wavelength. 


For the NUS and US synthesized CeO2 samples, the XRD pattern (Fig. 3) shows four main reﬂections (111), (200), (220) and (311) characteristic of CeO2 cubic phase with ﬂuorite structure (Ref. JCPDS card 34-394). NUS sample may be having faced centered cu- bic structure and such samples shows maximum peaks. 


From the XRD patterns (Fig. 3), it is also possible to compute the % crystallinity and crystallite size. The amorphous phase fraction of the sample may be determined by taking the ratio of the amor- phous area (area not under the peaks) of the X-ray diffractogram to the total area. The area covered by the amorphous region means that the area of the diffractogram not contained by any sharp dif- fraction peaks. A method for estimation of amorphous phase frac- tion from XRD patterns have been developed by Prasad et al. 
[25,26] in our earlier work.



Crystallite size of the metal oxide samples may be obtained using the Debye–Scherrer equation. Vigneshwaran et al. [30,31] have used the Debye–Scherrer equation successfully for the esti- mation of size of nano ZnO in the past. The same procedure has been followed here. The Debye–Scherrer equation is used fre- quently in X-ray analysis of materials, particularly powder diffrac- tion of metal oxides. It relates the peak breadth of a speciﬁc phase of a material to the mean crystallite size of that material. It is quan- titative equivalent of saying that the larger the material’s crystal- lites are, sharper are the XRD peaks. According to the full width at half-maximum (FWHM) of the diffraction peaks, the average size of the particles (crystallite) are estimated from the Scherrer equation. 


All the computed results including % crystallinity and crystallite size have been tabulated in Table 1. XRD pattern of synthesized CeO2 for both NUS and US process exactly matches with the XRD pattern of CeO2. Also the peaks at different crystal planes of US synthesized CeO2 matches exactly with that of NUS synthesized CeO2 indicating essentially no difference with respect to the type of crystalline phase in the two products. The crystallinity of all the samples is still substantial because of the inherent characteris- tics of the sonically assisted process. It was found that NUS

synthesized CeO2 shows more crystallinity than US synthesized CeO2. This may be because of adverse environments created during sonication and facilitating faster reaction, not allowing the nucle- ation and crystal growth to occur fully. The local high energy dis- sipation rate due to cavitation phenomenon and micromixing caused by the incorporation of acoustic cavitation as a reaction aid, may increase the randomness of the Brownian motion of the CeO2 molecules not allowing regular crystal formation. This re- duces the ability of the molecules to remain in a stable lattice posi- tions for long, leading to the lowering of crystallinity. The peak broadening in the XRD pattern (for both samples) clearly indicates that very small nanocrystals are present in the samples. The peaks intensity in case of NUS synthesized CeO2 is more than the peaks intensity of US synthesized CeO2 which clearly indicates the pres- ence of larger crystals for NUS synthesized CeO2. Crystallite size of the US synthesized CeO2 was found also to be signiﬁcantly (6 nm against 30 nm) lower than NUS synthesized CeO2. It could also be due to the reduction in crystallinity. As the crystallinity of metal oxide reduces, its crystallite size is also known to reduce, which is consistent with the observations reported in our earlier work.

## 4.3. Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA)

The thermogravimetric (TGA) analysis (Fig. 4) shows the weight loss of synthesized CeO2 sample. It has been observed (Table 2) that continuous weight loss was occurred for both the samples (NUS and US synthesized CeO2). At 50 (cid:3)C, it has been observed that weight for NUS and US synthesized CeO2 are 1.22% and 3.11%, respectively. As the both samples get heated at 139 (cid:3)C, again nota- ble weight loss was found. It is 3.61% for NUS synthesized CeO2 and 
## 7.69% for US synthesized CeO2, when the water molecules (H2O)
start to disassociate themselves from Ce(OH)3. It has been found 


that at 550 (cid:3)C, total weight loss for NUS and US synthesized CeO2 was 8.81% and 14.83% respectively. Uses of ultrasound to the reac- tion mixture are changing their crystallography. And as explained in Section 4.2, the high energy generated due to cavitation phe- nomenon and micromixing caused by the same may increase the randomness of the Brownian motion of the CeO2 molecules not allowing regular crystal formation which leads to a decrease in thermal stability of the CeO2 which is conﬁrmed by weight loss ob- served for US process. Here, by observing results obtained in terms of % crystallinity, crystallite size and % weight loss for both the samples (NUS and US synthesized CeO2), we feel that as the crys- tallinity of the metal oxide decreases, its size is also found to be lowered and increased weight loss. Another possible reason behind the higher weight loss observed in case of US synthesized CeO2 may be attributed to the formation of agglomeration due to high energy. Enomoto et al. [32] and Prasad et al. [26] have reported that due to ultrasound irradiation, system consisting of suspended particles can cause agglomerations. This may be attributed to the formation of Ce–O–Ce bonds by combination reaction of Ce–OH bonds present on the surface of the particle species. This reaction is referred to as water condensation reaction [32,33].

These bonds are created by ultrasound enhanced high intensity collisions occurring between these particles in solution. The above mentioned observation of higher weight loss in the case of US syn- thesized sample could be due to this phenomenon. 


Another possible reason behind the weight loss observed in US synthesized CeO2 may be that as the average particle sizes

increasing the packing of these particles into other composite sys- tems. This not only helps in improving its effect on material prop- erties by increasing the effective surface area, reducing the overall reaction time but also aids in increasing the different types of crys- tals formed. 


## 5. Energy efﬁcacy

For the comparison of the energy required for these two synthe- sis methods (conventional (NUS) and sonochemical (US)) to obtain CeO2 nanomaterials, a sample calculation is reported in Appendix (I). We have already reported the work done on the energy efﬁcacy of the conventional and sonochemical processes. [25,34] The en- ergy utilized for the synthesis of CeO2 nanomaterial is the total en- ergy supplied (kJ) per unit weight of the material processed/ obtained (g). It is already explained in Section 4.1 that reaction time to synthesize ZnO were 20 min for US method and 4 h NUS method. Total energy required per unit weight of the material ob- tained to synthesize CeO2 is 15.15 (cid:3) 10(cid:4)2 (kJ/g) for US synthesis method and 200.43 (cid:3) 10(cid:4)2 (kJ/g) for NUS synthesis method. 


Thus, US synthesis method has proved to be an energy efﬁcient method which saved more than 92% of energy utilized by NUS syn- thesis method along with the reduced in the reaction duration. 


## 6. Conclusions

Nanostructured CeO2 particles were successfully synthesized, at room temperature, without stabilizers, by conventional (NUS) and sonochemical method (US). The sonochemical synthesis method has saved substantial energy (more than 92%) for the synthesis of CeO2. Thus, the sonochemical synthesis technique is fast, simple, convenient, time saving, economical, and environmentally benign. We believe that this method promises us a future large-scale syn- thesis for many applications in nanotechnology ﬁeld.

observed for the CeO2 synthesized by the US process is lower, it will conduct thermal radiation more efﬁciently and thus at a lower temperature it would feel a more signiﬁcant effect of thermal con- vective currents leading to a possible phase transformation and thus weight loss can happen. However, more work needs to be car- ried out before it can be conclusively said so. 


## 4.4. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM)

From the SEM micrographs (Figs. 5–7) of the NUS and US syn- thesized CeO2 samples some observations have been made, that supported the results observed from the XRD patterns. We have compared the SEM image results of the CeO2 for NUS (Fig. 5A) and US (Fig. 5B) at the same magniﬁcation of 500X. The US synthe- sized CeO2 shows not only comparatively smaller particle size but also considerably less agglomeration. Here, we have interestingly observed that structure of NUS synthesized CeO2 consists of small particles aggregated with larger particles but this is not observed for US synthesized CeO2 material. These particles are smooth and sharp cuts (US synthesized) as compared to NUS synthesized par- ticles. This may be due to active surface charge present on NUS synthesized CeO2 material, resulting in agglomerated particles which may be lost in case of US synthesized CeO2 material because of local higher energy dissipation and shock waves, generated by ultrasound at a higher magniﬁcation of 10,000X. Lesser agglomer- ation and uneven shaped structures are observed in the case of the US samples in general rather than the agglomerated looking parti- cles for NUS sample. 


Use of cavitation as a reaction aid has had its inﬂuence in the reaction step by considerably reducing their particle size and
